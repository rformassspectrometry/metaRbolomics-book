abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, {SMILES} format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats ({0D} versus {3D}, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats. {RESULTS}: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion. {CONCLUSIONS}: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and {2D} depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

Here, we review recent approaches to integrate multiple omics data in higher plants. We especially focus on metabolomics data management, normalization, meta-omics data analysis, and an integrative approach with other omics data. Further prospects for using metabolomics and the key points to be addressed are discussed. This could be a valuable strategy for a systems-level understanding of plant systems.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters to select peaks in the {LC}/{MS} profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics. {RESULTS}: Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the extracted ion chromatograms ({EICs}) to differentiate between true peak regions from noise regions in the {LC}/{MS} profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic ({pROC}) approach that can incorporate uncertainties. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the {apLCMS} package available at http://web1.sph.emory.edu/{apLCMS}/ {CONTACT}: tyu8@emory.edu {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2014.

This work describes a highly sensitive, broadly applicable, and cost-effective approach that allows metabolic profiling of live microbial colonies directly from a Petri dish without any sample preparation. Nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ({MS}), combined with alignment of {MS} data and molecular networking, enabled monitoring of metabolite production from live microbial colonies from diverse bacterial genera, including Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work demonstrates that, by using these tools to visualize small molecular changes within bacterial interactions, insights can be gained into bacterial developmental processes as a result of the improved organization of {MS}/{MS} data. To validate this experimental platform, metabolic profiling was performed on Pseudomonas sp. {SH}-C52, which protects sugar beet plants from infections by specific soil-borne fungi [R. Mendes et al. (2011) Science 332:1097-1100]. The antifungal effect of strain {SH}-C52 was attributed to thanamycin, a predicted lipopeptide encoded by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster. Our technology, in combination with our recently developed peptidogenomics strategy, enabled the detection and partial characterization of thanamycin and showed that it is a monochlorinated lipopeptide that belongs to the syringomycin family of antifungal agents. In conclusion, the platform presented here provides a significant advancement in our ability to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite production in live microbial colonies and communities.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA}) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. {RESULTS}: The {WGCNA} R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. {CONCLUSION}: The {WGCNA} package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed ({DE}) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of {DE} genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. {RESULTS}: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis ({SPIA}) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that {SPIA} has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {AVAILABILITY}: {SPIA} was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/}

The higher order functional information is stored in the {PATHWAY} database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The {PATHWAY} database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in {KEGG} is {LIGAND} for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. {KEGG} provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).}

abstract = {{MetaboAnalyst} (www.metaboanalyst.ca) is a web server designed to permit comprehensive metabolomic data analysis, visualization and interpretation. It supports a wide range of complex statistical calculations and high quality graphical rendering functions that require significant computational resources. First introduced in 2009, {MetaboAnalyst} has experienced more than a {50X} growth in user traffic (\textgreater50 000 jobs processed each month). In order to keep up with the rapidly increasing computational demands and a growing number of requests to support translational and systems biology applications, we performed a substantial rewrite and major feature upgrade of the server. The result is {MetaboAnalyst} 3.0. By completely re-implementing the {MetaboAnalyst} suite using the latest web framework technologies, we have been able substantially improve its performance, capacity and user interactivity. Three new modules have also been added including: (i) a module for biomarker analysis based on the calculation of receiver operating characteristic curves; (ii) a module for sample size estimation and power analysis for improved planning of metabolomics studies and (iii) a module to support integrative pathway analysis for both genes and metabolites. In addition, popular features found in existing modules have been significantly enhanced by upgrading the graphical output, expanding the compound libraries and by adding support for more diverse organisms. \copyright The Author(s) 2015.

However, current approaches can be limited by biochemical domain or pathway knowledge which results in sparse disconnected graphs for real world metabolomic experiments. {MetaMapR} integrates enzymatic transformations with metabolite structural similarity, mass spectral similarity and empirical associations to generate richly connected metabolic networks. This open source, web-based or desktop software, written in the R programming language, leverages {KEGG} and {PubChem} databases to derive associations between metabolites even in cases where biochemical domain or molecular annotations are unknown. Network calculation is enhanced through an interface to the Chemical Translation System, which allows metabolite identifier translation between \textgreater200 common biochemical databases.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Metabolite profiling, the simultaneous quantification of multiple metabolites in an experiment, is becoming increasingly popular, particularly with the rise of systems-level biology. The workhorse in this field is gas-chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}). The high-throughput of this technology coupled with a demand for large experiments has led to data pre-processing, i.e. the quantification of metabolites across samples, becoming a major bottleneck. Existing software has several limitations, including restricted maximum sample size, systematic errors and low flexibility. However, the biggest limitation is that the resulting data usually require extensive hand-curation, which is subjective and can typically take several days to weeks. {RESULTS}: We introduce the {TargetSearch} package, an open source tool which is a flexible and accurate method for pre-processing even very large numbers of {GC}-{MS} samples within hours. We developed a novel strategy to iteratively correct and update retention time indices for searching and identifying metabolites. The package is written in the R programming language with computationally intensive functions written in C for speed and performance. The package includes a graphical user interface to allow easy use by those unfamiliar with R. {CONCLUSIONS}: {TargetSearch} allows fast and accurate data pre-processing for {GC}-{MS} experiments and overcomes the sample number limitations and manual curation requirements of existing software. We validate our method by carrying out an analysis against both a set of known chemical standard mixtures and of a biological experiment. In addition we demonstrate its capabilities and speed by comparing it with other {GC}-{MS} pre-processing tools. We believe this package will greatly ease current bottlenecks and facilitate the analysis of metabolic profiling data.}

We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.}

In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment.

The metabolites form an important layer in the complex metabolic network, and the interactions between different metabolites are often of interest. It is crucial to perform proper normalization of metabolomics data, but current methods may not be applicable when estimating interactions in the form of correlations between metabolites. We propose a normalization approach based on a mixed model, with simultaneous estimation of a correlation matrix. We also investigate how the common use of a calibration standard in nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) experiments affects the estimation of correlations. {RESULTS}: We show with both real and simulated data that our proposed normalization method is robust and has good performance when discovering true correlations between metabolites. The standardization of {NMR} data is shown in simulation studies to affect our ability to discover true correlations to a small extent. However, comparing standardized and non-standardized real data does not result in any large differences in correlation estimates. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Source code is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/metabnorm/ {CONTACT}: alexandra.jauhiainen@ki.se {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2014.

Since pilot studies are rarely done in metabolomics, currently existing sample size estimation approaches which rely on pilot data can not be applied. {RESULTS}: In this article, an analysis based approach called {MetSizeR} is developed to estimate sample size for metabolomic experiments even when experimental pilot data are not available. The key motivation for {MetSizeR} is that it considers the type of analysis the researcher intends to use for data analysis when estimating sample size. {MetSizeR} uses information about the data analysis technique and prior expert knowledge of the metabolomic experiment to simulate pilot data from a statistical model. Permutation based techniques are then applied to the simulated pilot data to estimate the required sample size. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {MetSizeR} methodology, and a publicly available software package which implements the approach, are illustrated through real metabolomic applications. Sample size estimates, informed by the intended statistical analysis technique, and the associated uncertainty are provided.}

abstract = {Most mass spectrometry based metabolomics studies are semiquantitative and depend on efficient normalization techniques to suppress systematic error. A common approach is to include isotope-labeled internal standards ({ISs}) and then express the estimated metabolite abundances relative to the {IS}. Because of problems such as insufficient chromatographic resolution, however, the analytes may directly influence estimates of the {IS}, a phenomenon known as cross-contribution ({CC}). Normalization using {ISs} that suffer from {CC} effects will cause significant loss of information if the interfering analytes are associated with the studied factors. We present a novel normalization algorithm, which compensates for systematic {CC} effects that can be traced back to a linear association with the experimental design. The proposed method was found to be superior at purifying the signal of interest compared to current normalization methods when applied to two biological data sets and a multicomponent dilution mixture. Our method is applicable to data from randomized and designed experiments that use {ISs} to monitor the systematic error.}

We describe multiple co-inertia analysis ({MCIA}), an exploratory data analysis method that identifies co-relationships between multiple high dimensional datasets. Based on a covariance optimization criterion, {MCIA} simultaneously projects several datasets into the same dimensional space, transforming diverse sets of features onto the same scale, to extract the most variant from each dataset and facilitate biological interpretation and pathway analysis. {RESULTS}: We demonstrate integration of multiple layers of information using {MCIA}, applied to two typical "omics" research scenarios. The integration of transcriptome and proteome profiles of cells in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell line panel revealed distinct, complementary features, which together increased the coverage and power of pathway analysis. Our analysis highlighted the importance of the leukemia extravasation signaling pathway in leukemia that was not highly ranked in the analysis of any individual dataset. Secondly, we compared transcriptome profiles of high grade serous ovarian tumors that were obtained, on two different microarray platforms and next generation {RNA}-sequencing, to identify the most informative platform and extract robust biomarkers of molecular subtypes. We discovered that the variance of {RNA}-sequencing data processed using {RPKM} had greater variance than that with {MapSplice} and {RSEM}. We provided novel markers highly associated to tumor molecular subtype combined from four data platforms. {MCIA} is implemented and available in the R/Bioconductor "omicade4" package. {CONCLUSION}: We believe {MCIA} is an attractive method for data integration and visualization of several datasets of multi-omics features observed on the same set of individuals. The method is not dependent on feature annotation, and thus it can extract important features even when there are not present across all datasets. {MCIA} provides simple graphical representations for the identification of relationships between large datasets.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Principal component analysis ({PCA}) has been widely used to visualize high-dimensional metabolomic data in a two- or three-dimensional subspace. In metabolomics, some metabolites (e.g., the top 10 metabolites) have been subjectively selected when using factor loading in {PCA}, and biological inferences are made for these metabolites. However, this approach may lead to biased biological inferences because these metabolites are not objectively selected with statistical criteria. {RESULTS}: We propose a statistical procedure that selects metabolites with statistical hypothesis testing of the factor loading in {PCA} and makes biological inferences about these significant metabolites with a metabolite set enrichment analysis ({MSEA}). This procedure depends on the fact that the eigenvector in {PCA} for autoscaled data is proportional to the correlation coefficient between the {PC} score and each metabolite level. We applied this approach to two sets of metabolomic data from mouse liver samples: 136 of 282 metabolites in the first case study and 66 of 275 metabolites in the second case study were statistically significant. This result suggests that to set the number of metabolites before the analysis is inappropriate because the number of significant metabolites differs in each study when factor loading is used in {PCA}. Moreover, when an {MSEA} of these significant metabolites was performed, significant metabolic pathways were detected, which were acceptable in terms of previous biological knowledge. {CONCLUSIONS}: It is essential to select metabolites statistically to make unbiased biological inferences from metabolomic data when using factor loading in {PCA}. We propose a statistical procedure to select metabolites with statistical hypothesis testing of the factor loading in {PCA}, and to draw biological inferences about these significant metabolites with {MSEA}. We have developed an R package "mseapca" to facilitate this approach. The "mseapca" package is publicly available at the {CRAN} website.}

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database ({HMDB}) (www.hmdb.ca) is a resource dedicated to providing scientists with the most current and comprehensive coverage of the human metabolome. Since its first release in 2007, the {HMDB} has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of {HMDB} (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600\% increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the {HMDB}, which was previously featured in the 2009 {NAR} Database Issue. (Note to referees, {HMDB} 3.0 will go live on 18 September 2012.).}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Metabolomics is an emerging high-throughput approach to systems biology, but data analysis tools are lacking compared to other systems level disciplines such as transcriptomics and proteomics. Metabolomic data analysis requires a normalization step to remove systematic effects of confounding variables on metabolite measurements. Current tools may not correctly normalize every metabolite when the relationships between each metabolite quantity and fixed-effect confounding variables are different, or for the effects of random-effect confounding variables. Linear mixed models, an established methodology in the microarray literature, offer a standardized and flexible approach for removing the effects of fixed- and random-effect confounding variables from metabolomic data. {FINDINGS}: Here we present a simple menu-driven program, "{MetabR}", designed to aid researchers with no programming background in statistical analysis of metabolomic data. Written in the open-source statistical programming language R, {MetabR} implements linear mixed models to normalize metabolomic data and analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) to test treatment differences. {MetabR} exports normalized data, checks statistical model assumptions, identifies differentially abundant metabolites, and produces output files to help with data interpretation. Example data are provided to illustrate normalization for common confounding variables and to demonstrate the utility of the {MetabR} program. {CONCLUSIONS}: We developed {MetabR} as a simple and user-friendly tool for implementing linear mixed model-based normalization and statistical analysis of targeted metabolomic data, which helps to fill a lack of available data analysis tools in this field. The program, user guide, example data, and any future news or updates related to the program may be found at http://metabr.r-forge.r-project.org/.}

However, the development of such an analysis is a major computational and technical challenge as most approaches suffer from high data dimensionality. New methodologies need to be developed and validated. {RESULTS}: {integrOmics} efficiently performs integrative analyses of two types of 'omics' variables that are measured on the same samples. It includes a regularized version of canonical correlation analysis to enlighten correlations between two datasets, and a sparse version of partial least squares ({PLS}) regression that includes simultaneous variable selection in both datasets.

The protocols interact with software resources specifically for metabolomics provided in a Web-accessible data analysis package {FIEmspro} (http://users.aber.ac.uk/jhd) written in the R environment and requiring a moderate knowledge of R command-line usage. Specific emphasis is placed on describing the outcome of modeling experiments using {FIE}-{MS} data that require further preprocessing to improve quality.

Therefore, of fundamental interest for every enzyme is the elucidation of its natural substrates. Here, we describe a general strategy for identifying endogenous substrates of enzymes by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) analysis of tissue metabolomes from wild-type and enzyme-inactivated organisms. We use this method to discover several brain lipids regulated by the mammalian enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase ({FAAH}) in vivo, including known signaling molecules (e.g., the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) and a novel family of nervous system-enriched natural products, the taurine-conjugated fatty acids. Remarkably, the relative hydrolytic activity that {FAAH} exhibited for lipid metabolites in vitro was not predictive of the identity of specific {FAAH} substrates in vivo. Thus, global metabolite profiling establishes unanticipated connections between the proteome and metabolome that enable assignment of an enzyme's unique biochemical functions in vivo.}

In this paper we present our efforts to produce an equally simple and powerful format, {PeakML}, to uniformly exchange processed intermediary and result data. To demonstrate the versatility of {PeakML}, we have developed an open source Java toolkit for processing, filtering, and annotating mass spectra in a customizable pipeline ({mzMatch}), as well as a user-friendly data visualization environment ({PeakML} Viewer). The {PeakML} format in particular enables the flexible exchange of processed data between software created by different groups or companies, as we illustrate by providing a {PeakML}-based integration of the widely used {XCMS} package with {mzMatch} data processing tools. As an added advantage, downstream analysis can benefit from direct access to the full mass trace information underlying summarized mass spectrometry results, providing the user with the means to rapidly verify results.

Here we present {CAMERA}, a Bioconductor package integrating algorithms to extract compound spectra, annotate isotope and adduct peaks, and propose the accurate compound mass even in highly complex data. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of {CAMERA} against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. {CAMERA} successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7\% and 90.3\% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate. We demonstrate the utility of {CAMERA} in two different, easily adoptable plant metabolomics experiments, where the application of {CAMERA} drastically reduced the amount of manual analysis. \copyright 2011 American Chemical Society}

abstract = {Despite the extensive use of nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) for metabolomics, no publicly available tools have been designed for identifying and quantifying metabolites across multiple spectra. We introduce here a new open source software tool, {rNMR}, which provides a simple graphics-based method for visualizing, identifying, and quantifying metabolites across multiple one- or two-dimensional {NMR} spectra. {rNMR} differs from existing software tools for {NMR} spectroscopy in that analyses are based on regions of interest ({ROIs}) rather than peak lists. {ROIs} contain all of the underlying {NMR} data within user-defined chemical shift ranges. {ROIs} can be inspected visually, and they support robust quantification of {NMR} signals. {ROI}-based analyses support simultaneous views of metabolite signals from up to hundreds of spectra, and {ROI} boundaries can be adjusted dynamically to ensure that signals corresponding to assigned atoms are analyzed consistently throughout the dataset. We describe how {rNMR} greatly reduces the time required for robust bioanalytical analysis of complex {NMR} data. An {rNMR} analysis yields a compact and transparent way of archiving the results from a metabolomics study so that it can be examined and evaluated by others. The {rNMR} website at http://rnmr.nmrfam.wisc.edu offers downloadable versions of {rNMR} for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux platforms along with extensive help documentation, instructional videos, and sample data.}

Since its first release in 2007, the {HMDB} has been used to facilitate the research for nearly 100 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of {HMDB} (version 2.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the previous release (version 1.0). In particular, the number of fully annotated metabolite entries has grown from 2180 to more than 6800 (a 300\% increase), while the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data has grown by a factor of five (from 883 to 4413). Similarly, the number of purified compounds with reference to {NMR}, {LC}-{MS} and {GC}-{MS} spectra has more than doubled (from 380 to more than 790 compounds). In addition to this significant expansion in database size, many new database searching tools and new data content has been added or enhanced. These include better algorithms for spectral searching and matching, more powerful chemical substructure searches, faster text searching software, as well as dedicated pathway searching tools and customized, clickable metabolic maps. Changes to the user-interface have also been implemented to accommodate future expansion and to make database navigation much easier. These improvements should make the {HMDB} much more useful to a much wider community of users.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families. {RESULTS}: Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite. {CONCLUSIONS}: graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements.}

abstract = {When dealing with large scale gene expression studies, observations are commonly contaminated by sources of unwanted variation such as platforms or batches. Not taking this unwanted variation into account when analyzing the data can lead to spurious associations and to missing important signals. When the analysis is unsupervised, e.g. when the goal is to cluster the samples or to build a corrected version of the dataset--as opposed to the study of an observed factor of interest--taking unwanted variation into account can become a difficult task. The factors driving unwanted variation may be correlated with the unobserved factor of interest, so that correcting for the former can remove the latter if not done carefully. We show how negative control genes and replicate samples can be used to estimate unwanted variation in gene expression, and discuss how this information can be used to correct the expression data. The proposed methods are then evaluated on synthetic data and three gene expression datasets. They generally manage to remove unwanted variation without losing the signal of interest and compare favorably to state-of-the-art corrections. All proposed methods are implemented in the bioconductor package {RUVnormalize}. \copyright The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.}

To achieve its full potential, including the integration of multiple omics modalities, the accessibility, standardization and reproducibility of computational metabolomics tools must be improved significantly. {RESULTS}: Here we present our end-to-end mass spectrometry metabolomics workflow in the widely used platform, Galaxy. Named Galaxy-M, our workflow has been developed for both direct infusion mass spectrometry ({DIMS}) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) metabolomics. The range of tools presented spans from processing of raw data, e.g. peak picking and alignment, through data cleansing, e.g. missing value imputation, to preparation for statistical analysis, e.g. normalization and scaling, and principal components analysis ({PCA}) with associated statistical evaluation. We demonstrate the ease of using these Galaxy workflows via the analysis of {DIMS} and {LC}-{MS} datasets, and provide {PCA} scores and associated statistics to help other users to ensure that they can accurately repeat the processing and analysis of these two datasets. Galaxy and data are all provided pre-installed in a virtual machine ({VM}) that can be downloaded from the {GigaDB} repository. Additionally, source code, executables and installation instructions are available from {GitHub}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The Galaxy platform has enabled us to produce an easily accessible and reproducible computational metabolomics workflow.

In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the {ESI}-{MS}(2) data. {MassBank} also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed {ESI}-{MS}(2) data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23\% at a similarity score of 0.6.

Determining the boundaries, centres and intensities of the two-dimensional signals in the {LC}/{MS} raw data is called feature detection. For the subsequent analysis of complex samples such as plant extracts, which may contain hundreds of compounds, corresponding to thousands of features -- a reliable feature detection is mandatory. {RESULTS}: We developed a new feature detection algorithm {centWave} for high-resolution {LC}/{MS} data sets, which collects regions of interest (partial mass traces) in the raw-data, and applies continuous wavelet transformation and optionally Gauss-fitting in the chromatographic domain. We evaluated our feature detection algorithm on dilution series and mixtures of seed and leaf extracts, and estimated recall, precision and F-score of seed and leaf specific features in two experiments of different complexity. {CONCLUSION}: The new feature detection algorithm meets the requirements of current metabolomics experiments. {centWave} can detect close-by and partially overlapping features and has the highest overall recall and precision values compared to the other algorithms, {matchedFilter} (the original algorithm of {XCMS}) and the {centroidPicker} from {MZmine}.

abstract = {The aim of untargeted metabolomics is to profile as many metabolites as possible, yet a major challenge is comparing experimental method performance on the basis of metabolome coverage. To date, most published approaches have compared experimental methods by counting the total number of features detected. Due to artifactual interference, however, this number is highly variable and therefore is a poor metric for comparing metabolomic methods. Here we introduce an alternative approach to benchmarking metabolome coverage which relies on mixed Escherichia coli extracts from cells cultured in regular and (13)C-enriched media. After mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of these extracts, we "credential" features arising from E. coli metabolites on the basis of isotope spacing and intensity. This credentialing platform enables us to accurately compare the number of nonartifactual features yielded by different experimental approaches. We highlight the value of our platform by reoptimizing a published untargeted metabolomic method for {XCMS} data processing. Compared to the published parameters, the new {XCMS} parameters decrease the total number of features by 15\% (a reduction in noise features) while increasing the number of true metabolites detected and grouped by 20\%. Our credentialing platform relies on easily generated E. coli samples and a simple software algorithm that is freely available on our laboratory Web site (http://pattilab.wustl.edu/software/credential/). We have validated the credentialing platform with reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography as well as Agilent, Thermo Scientific, {AB} {SCIEX}, and {LECO} mass spectrometers. Thus, the credentialing platform can readily be applied by any laboratory to optimize their untargeted metabolomic pipeline for metabolite extraction, chromatographic separation, mass spectrometric detection, and bioinformatic processing.}

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on {MS}(2) data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality {MS}(2) data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic {MS}(2) data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating {MS}(2) fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from {MS}(2) spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect {MS}(2) scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating {MS}(2) fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for {MS}(2) analysis, we obtain deconvolved {MS}(2) spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw {MS}(2) data from the {METLIN} metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).}

Important application examples are the fields of metabolomics and proteomics. Parametric time warping ({PTW}) has already shown to be very useful in these fields because of the highly restricted form of the warping functions, avoiding overfitting. Here, we describe a new formulation of {PTW}, working on peak-picked features rather than on complete profiles. Not only does this allow for a much more smooth integration in existing pipelines, it also speeds up the (already among the fastest) algorithm by orders of magnitude. Using two publicly available datasets we show the potential of the new approach. The first set is a {LC}-{DAD} dataset of grape samples, and the second an {LC}-{MS} dataset of apple extracts. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Parametric time warping of peak lists is implemented in the ptw package, version 1.9.1 and onwards, available from Github (https://github.com/rwehrens/ptw) and {CRAN} (http://cran.r-project.org).

Importantly, hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography (a key separation technology for metabolomics) produces data which are especially challenging to process. We identify three critical points of failure in current informatic workflows: compound specific drift, integration region variance, and naive missing value imputation. We implement the Warpgroup algorithm to address these challenges. {RESULTS}: Warpgroup adds peak subregion detection, consensus integration bound detection, and intelligent missing value imputation steps to the conventional informatic workflow. When compared with the conventional workflow, Warpgroup made major improvements to the processed data. The coefficient of variation for peaks detected in replicate injections of a complex Escherichia Coli extract were halved (a reduction of 19\%). Integration regions across samples were much more robust. Additionally, many signals lost by the conventional workflow were 'rescued' by the Warpgroup refinement, thereby resulting in greater analyte coverage in the processed data. {AVAILABILITY} {AND}: I: {MPLEMENTATION}: Warpgroup is an open source R package available on {GitHub} at github.com/nathaniel-mahieu/warpgroup.

Fortunately, a variety of software programs are now available to automate the data analysis. Selection of the appropriate processing solution is dependent upon experimental design. Most metabolomic studies a decade ago had a relatively simple experimental design in which the intensities of compounds were compared between only two sample groups. More recently, however, increasingly sophisticated applications have been pursued. Examples include comparing compound intensities between multiple sample groups and unbiasedly tracking the fate of specific isotopic labels. The latter types of applications have necessitated the development of new software programs, which have introduced additional functionalities that facilitate data analysis. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the freely available bioinformatic solutions that are either based upon or are compatible with the algorithms in {XCMS}, which we broadly refer to here as the '{XCMS} family' of software. These include {CAMERA}, credentialing, Warpgroup, {metaXCMS}, X(13){CMS}, and {XCMS} Online. Together, these informatic technologies can accommodate most cutting-edge metabolomic applications and offer unique advantages when compared to the original {XCMS} program.

abstract = {Studies of isotopically labeled compounds have been fundamental to understanding metabolic pathways and fluxes. They have traditionally, however, been used in conjunction with targeted analyses that identify and quantify a limited number of labeled downstream metabolites. Here we describe an alternative workflow that leverages recent advances in untargeted metabolomic technologies to track the fates of isotopically labeled metabolites in a global, unbiased manner. This untargeted approach can be applied to discover novel biochemical pathways and characterize changes in the fates of labeled metabolites as a function of altered biological conditions such as disease. To facilitate the data analysis, we introduce X(13){CMS}, an extension of the widely used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic software package {XCMS}. X(13){CMS} uses the {XCMS} platform to detect metabolite peaks and perform retention-time alignment in liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}) data. With the use of the {XCMS} output, the program then identifies isotopologue groups that correspond to isotopically labeled compounds. The retrieval of these groups is done without any a priori knowledge besides the following input parameters: (i) the mass difference between the unlabeled and labeled isotopes, (ii) the mass accuracy of the instrument used in the analysis, and (iii) the estimated retention-time reproducibility of the chromatographic method. Despite its name, X(13){CMS} can be used to track any isotopic label. Additionally, it detects differential labeling patterns in biological samples collected from parallel control and experimental conditions. We validated the ability of X(13){CMS} to accurately retrieve labeled metabolites from complex biological matrices both with targeted {LC}/{MS}/{MS} analysis of a subset of the hits identified by the program and with labeled standards spiked into cell extracts. We demonstrate the full functionality of X(13){CMS} with an analysis of cultured rat astrocytes treated with uniformly labeled (U-)(13)C-glucose during lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) challenge. Our results show that out of 223 isotopologue groups enriched from U-(13)C-glucose, 95 have statistically significant differential labeling patterns in astrocytes challenged with {LPS} compared to unchallenged control cells. Only two of these groups overlap with the 32 differentially regulated peaks identified by {XCMS}, indicating that X(13){CMS} uncovers different and complementary information from untargeted metabolomic studies. Like {XCMS}, X(13){CMS} is implemented in R. It is available from our laboratory website at http://pattilab.wustl.edu/x13cms.php .}

However, when hundreds or thousands of {MRM} transitions are measured with tens to hundreds of biological samples, the complexity of {MRM} dataset acquired is no longer amenable to manual evaluation, and presents a challenge for targeted metabolomics. Here, we developed an R package, namely {MRMAnalyzer}, to process large set of {MRM}-based targeted metabolomics data automatically without any manual intervention. To demonstrate our {MRMAnalyzer} program, we first developed a targeted metabolomic method that simultaneously analyzes 182 metabolites in one 15-min {LC} run, and demonstrated the data processing procedures using {MRMAnalyzer}. The data processing steps include \textquotedblleftpseudo\textquotedblright accurate m/z transformation, peak detection and alignment, metabolite identification, quality control check and statistical analysis. Finally, a targeted metabolomic assay was designed and integrated with {MRMAnalyzer} to profile the metabolic changes in Escherichia coli subjected to the protein expression. The generated {MRM} dataset consisting of more than 8000 {MRM} transitions were readily processed using {MRMAnalyzer} within 20 min without any manual intervention. Fourty seven out of 140 detected metabolites, enriched in six metabolic pathways, were found significantly affected in E. coli metabolome. In summary, a targeted metabolomic platform is developed for high-throughput metabolite profiling and automated data processing, and the {MRMAnalyzer} program is a high efficient informatics tool for large scale targeted metabolomics.}

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of metabolic fluxes in biochemical networks is of major interest in systems biology. Several databases provide metabolic reconstructions for different organisms. Software to analyze flux distributions exists, among others for the proprietary {MATLAB} environment. Given the large user community for the R computing environment, a simple implementation of flux analysis in R appears desirable and will facilitate easy interaction with computational tools to handle gene expression data. We extended the R software package {BiGGR}, an implementation of metabolic flux analysis in R. {BiGGR} makes use of public metabolic reconstruction databases, and contains the {BiGG} database and the reconstruction of human metabolism Recon2 as Systems Biology Markup Language ({SBML}) objects. Models can be assembled by querying the databases for pathways, genes or reactions of interest. Fluxes can then be estimated by maximization or minimization of an objective function using linear inverse modeling algorithms. Furthermore, {BiGGR} provides functionality to quantify the uncertainty in flux estimates by sampling the constrained multidimensional flux space. As a result, ensembles of possible flux configurations are constructed that agree with measured data within precision limits. {BiGGR} also features automatic visualization of selected parts of metabolic networks using hypergraphs, with hyperedge widths proportional to estimated flux values. {BiGGR} supports import and export of models encoded in {SBML} and is therefore interoperable with different modeling and analysis tools. As an application example, we calculated the flux distribution in healthy human brain using a model of central carbon metabolism. We introduce a new algorithm termed Least-squares with equalities and inequalities Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-{FBA}) to predict flux changes from gene expression changes, for instance during disease. Our estimates of brain metabolic flux pattern with Lsei-{FBA} for Alzheimer's disease agree with independent measurements of cerebral metabolism in patients.

Common methods used to assign and estimate concentrations of metabolites involve either an expert manual peak fitting or extra pre-processing steps, such as peak alignment and binning. Peak fitting is very time consuming and is subject to human error. Conversely, alignment and binning can introduce artefacts and limit immediate biological interpretation of models. {RESULTS}: We present the Bayesian automated metabolite analyser for {NMR} spectra ({BATMAN}), an R package that deconvolutes peaks from one-dimensional {NMR} spectra, automatically assigns them to specific metabolites from a target list and obtains concentration estimates. The Bayesian model incorporates information on characteristic peak patterns of metabolites and is able to account for shifts in the position of peaks commonly seen in {NMR} spectra of biological samples. It applies a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from a joint posterior distribution of the model parameters and obtains concentration estimates with reduced error compared with conventional numerical integration and comparable to manual deconvolution by experienced spectroscopists. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/t.ebbels/ {CONTACT}: t.ebbels@imperial.ac.uk.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ({NMR}) is a powerful technique to reveal and compare quantitative metabolic profiles of biological tissues. However, chemical and physical sample variations make the analysis of the data challenging, and typically require the application of a number of preprocessing steps prior to data interpretation. For example, noise reduction, normalization, baseline correction, peak picking, spectrum alignment and statistical analysis are indispensable components in any {NMR} analysis pipeline. {RESULTS}: We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of {NMR} metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment ({CluPA}). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation ({FFT}) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the {NMR} spectra. For each aligned {NMR} data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares ({BW}-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of {NMR} spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way {ANOVA}, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the {BW}-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data. {CONCLUSIONS}: The workflow performance was evaluated using a previously published dataset. Correlation maps, spectral and grey scale plots show clear improvements in comparison to other methods, and the down-to-earth quantitative analysis works well for the {CluPA}-aligned spectra. The whole workflow is embedded into a modular and statistically sound framework that is implemented as an R package called "speaq" ("spectrum alignment and quantitation"), which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/speaq/.}

abstract = {The potential of the diverse chemistries present in natural products ({NP}) for biotechnology and medicine remains untapped because {NP} databases are not searchable with raw data and the {NP} community has no way to share data other than in published papers. Although mass spectrometry ({MS}) techniques are well-suited to high-throughput characterization of {NP}, there is a pressing need for an infrastructure to enable sharing and curation of data. We present Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking ({GNPS}; http://gnps.ucsd.edu), an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass ({MS}/{MS}) spectrometry data. In {GNPS}, crowdsourced curation of freely available community-wide reference {MS} libraries will underpin improved annotations. Data-driven social-networking should facilitate identification of spectra and foster collaborations. We also introduce the concept of 'living data' through continuous reanalysis of deposited data.}

abstract = {Putting new findings into the context of available literature knowledge is one approach to deal with the surge of high-throughput data results. Furthermore, prior knowledge can increase the performance and stability of bioinformatic algorithms, for example, methods for network reconstruction. In this review, we examine software packages for the statistical computing framework R, which enable the integration of pathway data for further bioinformatic analyses. Different approaches to integrate and visualize pathway data are identified and packages are stratified concerning their features according to a number of different aspects: data import strategies, the extent of available data, dependencies on external tools, integration with further analysis steps and visualization options are considered. A total of 12 packages integrating pathway data are reviewed in this manuscript. These are supplemented by five R-specific packages for visualization and six connector packages, which provide access to external tools.},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ({GC} × {GC}-{MS}) is a powerful technique which has gained increasing attention over the last two decades. The {GC} × {GC}-{MS} provides much increased separation capacity, chemical selectivity and sensitivity for complex sample analysis and brings more accurate information about compound retention times and mass spectra. Despite these advantages, the retention times of the resolved peaks on the two-dimensional gas chromatographic columns are always shifted due to experimental variations, introducing difficulty in the data processing for metabolomics analysis. Therefore, the retention time variation must be adjusted in order to compare multiple metabolic profiles obtained from different conditions. {RESULTS}: We developed novel peak alignment algorithms for both homogeneous (acquired under the identical experimental conditions) and heterogeneous (acquired under the different experimental conditions) {GC} × {GC}-{MS} data using modified Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithms along with mass spectral similarity. Compared with literature reported algorithms, the proposed algorithms eliminated the detection of landmark peaks and the usage of retention time transformation. Furthermore, an automated peak alignment software package was established by implementing a likelihood function for optimal peak alignment. {CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed Smith-Waterman local alignment-based algorithms are capable of aligning both the homogeneous and heterogeneous data of multiple {GC} × {GC}-{MS} experiments without the transformation of retention times and the selection of landmark peaks. An optimal version of the {SW}-based algorithms was also established based on the associated likelihood function for the automatic peak alignment. The proposed alignment algorithms outperform the literature reported alignment method by analyzing the experiment data of a mixture of compound standards and a metabolite extract of mouse plasma with spiked-in compound standards.}

We review multi-assay genomic data resources in the areas of clinical oncology, pharmacogenomics and other perturbation experiments, population genomics and regulatory genomics and other areas, and tools for data acquisition. Finally, we review bioinformatic tools that are explicitly geared toward integrative genomic data visualization and analysis.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Detection of low abundance metabolites is important for de novo mapping of metabolic pathways related to diet, microbiome or environmental exposures. Multiple algorithms are available to extract m/z features from liquid chromatography-mass spectral data in a conservative manner, which tends to preclude detection of low abundance chemicals and chemicals found in small subsets of samples. The present study provides software to enhance such algorithms for feature detection, quality assessment, and annotation. {RESULTS}: {xMSanalyzer} is a set of utilities for automated processing of metabolomics data. The utilites can be classified into four main modules to: 1) improve feature detection for replicate analyses by systematic re-extraction with multiple parameter settings and data merger to optimize the balance between sensitivity and reliability, 2) evaluate sample quality and feature consistency, 3) detect feature overlap between datasets, and 4) characterize high-resolution m/z matches to small molecule metabolites and biological pathways using multiple chemical databases. The package was tested with plasma samples and shown to more than double the number of features extracted while improving quantitative reliability of detection. {MS}/{MS} analysis of a random subset of peaks that were exclusively detected using {xMSanalyzer} confirmed that the optimization scheme improves detection of real metabolites. {CONCLUSIONS}: {xMSanalyzer} is a package of utilities for data extraction, quality control assessment, detection of overlapping and unique metabolites in multiple datasets, and batch annotation of metabolites. The program was designed to integrate with existing packages such as {apLCMS} and {XCMS}, but the framework can also be used to enhance data extraction for other {LC}/{MS} data software.}

abstract = {Large-scale "omics" data, such as microarrays, can be used to infer underlying cellular regulatory networks in organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2 experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the {DiffCorr} package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient. {DiffCorr} calculates correlation matrices for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based "eigen-molecules" in the correlation networks, and tests differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks. {DiffCorr} can explore differential correlations between 2 conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely transcriptomics and metabolomics. {DiffCorr} is simple to use in calculating differential correlations and is suitable for the first step towards inferring causal relationships and detecting biomarker candidates.

Scoring of hits is based on a "shared peak count" method that identifies masses of fragment ions shared between the analytical and reference {MS}/{MS} spectra. Another functional component of {XCMS}(2) is the capability of providing structural information for unknown metabolites, which are not in the {METLIN} database. This "similarity search" algorithm has been developed to detect possible structural motifs in the unknown metabolite which may produce characteristic fragment ions and neutral losses to related reference compounds contained in {METLIN}, even if the precursor masses are not the same.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. {RESULTS}: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method ({missForest}) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10\% to 30\%. We show that {missForest} can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, {missForest} outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of {missForest} prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, {missForest} exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. {AVAILABILITY}: The package {missForest} is freely available from http://stat.ethz.ch/{CRAN}/. {CONTACT}: stekhoven@stat.math.ethz.ch; buhlmann@stat.math.ethz.ch}

Molecular-level functions are stored in the {KO} ({KEGG} Orthology) database, where each {KO} is defined as a functional ortholog of genes and proteins. Higher-level functions are represented by networks of molecular interactions, reactions and relations in the forms of {KEGG} pathway maps, {BRITE} hierarchies and {KEGG} modules. In the past the {KO} database was developed for the purpose of defining nodes of molecular networks, but now the content has been expanded and the quality improved irrespective of whether or not the {KOs} appear in the three molecular network databases. The newly introduced addendum category of the {GENES} database is a collection of individual proteins whose functions are experimentally characterized and from which an increasing number of {KOs} are defined. Furthermore, the {DISEASE} and {DRUG} databases have been improved by systematic analysis of drug labels for better integration of diseases and drugs with the {KEGG} molecular networks. {KEGG} is moving towards becoming a comprehensive knowledge base for both functional interpretation and practical application of genomic information. \copyright The Author(s) 2016.

In principle, measurement of more than one million chemicals would be possible if algorithms were available to facilitate utilization of the raw mass spectrometry data, especially low-abundance metabolites. Here we describe an automated computational framework to annotate ions for possible chemical identity using a multistage clustering algorithm in which metabolic pathway associations are used along with intensity profiles, retention time characteristics, mass defect, and isotope/adduct patterns. The algorithm uses high-resolution mass spectrometry data for a series of samples with common properties and publicly available chemical, metabolic, and environmental databases to assign confidence levels to annotation results. Evaluation results show that the algorithm achieves an F1-measure of 0.8 for a data set with known targets and is more robust than previously reported results for cases when database size is much greater than the actual number of metabolites. {MS}/{MS} evaluation of a set of randomly selected 210 metabolites annotated using {xMSannotator} in an untargeted metabolomics human data set shows that 80\% of features with high or medium confidence scores have ion dissociation patterns consistent with the {xMSannotator} annotation. The algorithm has been incorporated into an R package, {xMSannotator}, which includes utilities for querying local or online databases such as {ChemSpider}, {KEGG}, {HMDB}, {T3DB}, and {LipidMaps}.}

abstract = {A long-standing challenge of untargeted metabolomic profiling by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry ({UHPLC}-{HRMS}) is efficient transition from unknown mass spectral features to confident metabolite annotations. The {compMS2Miner} (Comprehensive {MS2} Miner) package was developed in the R language to facilitate rapid, comprehensive feature annotation using a peak-picker-output and {MS2} data files as inputs. The number of {MS2} spectra that can be collected during a metabolomic profiling experiment far outweigh the amount of time required for pain-staking manual interpretation; therefore, a degree of software workflow autonomy is required for broad-scale metabolite annotation. {CompMS2Miner} integrates many useful tools in a single workflow for metabolite annotation and also provides a means to overview the {MS2} data with a Web application {GUI} {compMS2Explorer} (Comprehensive {MS2} Explorer) that also facilitates data-sharing and transparency. The automatable {compMS2Miner} workflow consists of the following steps: (i) matching unknown {MS1} features to precursor {MS2} scans, (ii) filtration of spectral noise (dynamic noise filter), (iii) generation of composite mass spectra by multiple similar spectrum signal summation and redundant/contaminant spectra removal, (iv) interpretation of possible fragment ion substructure using an internal database, (v) annotation of unknowns with chemical and spectral databases with prediction of mammalian biotransformation metabolites, wrapper functions for in silico fragmentation software, nearest neighbor chemical similarity scoring, random forest based retention time prediction, text-mining based false positive removal/true positive ranking, chemical taxonomic prediction and differential evolution based global annotation score optimization, and (vi) network graph visualizations, data curation, and sharing are made possible via the {compMS2Explorer} application. Metabolite identities and comments can also be recorded using an interactive table within {compMS2Explorer}. The utility of the package is illustrated with a data set of blood serum samples from 7 diet induced obese ({DIO}) and 7 nonobese ({NO}) {C57BL}/{6J} mice, which were also treated with an antibiotic (streptomycin) to knockdown the gut microbiota. The results of fully autonomous and objective usage of {compMS2Miner} are presented here. All automatically annotated spectra output by the workflow are provided in the Supporting Information and can alternatively be explored as publically available {compMS2Explorer} applications for both positive and negative modes ( https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/{compMS2\_mouseSera\_POS} and https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/{compMS2\_mouseSera\_NEG} ). The workflow provided rapid annotation of a diversity of endogenous and gut microbially derived metabolites affected by both diet and antibiotic treatment, which conformed to previously published reports. Composite spectra (n = 173) were autonomously matched to entries of the Massbank of North America ({MoNA}) spectral repository. These experimental and virtual ({lipidBlast}) spectra corresponded to 29 common endogenous compound classes (e.g., 51 lysophosphatidylcholines spectra) and were then used to calculate the ranking capability of 7 individual scoring metrics. It was found that an average of the 7 individual scoring metrics provided the most effective weighted average ranking ability of 3 for the {MoNA} matched spectra in spite of potential risk of false positive annotations emerging from automation. Minor structural differences such as relative carbon-carbon double bond positions were found in several cases to affect the correct rank of the {MoNA} annotated metabolite. The latest release and an example workflow is available in the package vignette ( https://github.com/{WMBEdmands}/{compMS2Miner} ) and a version of the published application is available on the shinyapps.io site ( https://wmbedmands.shinyapps.io/{compMS2Example} ).}

abstract = {The predominance of partial least squares-discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) used to analyze metabolomics datasets (indeed, it is the most well-known tool to perform classification and regression in metabolomics), can be said to have led to the point that not all researchers are fully aware of alternative multivariate classification algorithms. This may in part be due to the widespread availability of {PLS}-{DA} in most of the well-known statistical software packages, where its implementation is very easy if the default settings are used. In addition, one of the perceived advantages of {PLS}-{DA} is that it has the ability to analyze highly collinear and noisy data. Furthermore, the calibration model is known to provide a variety of useful statistics, such as prediction accuracy as well as scores and loadings plots. However, this method may provide misleading results, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical validation, when used by non-experts who are not aware of its potential limitations when used in conjunction with metabolomics. This tutorial review aims to provide an introductory overview to several straightforward statistical methods such as principal component-discriminant function analysis ({PC}-{DFA}), support vector machines ({SVM}) and random forests ({RF}), which could very easily be used either to augment {PLS} or as alternative supervised learning methods to {PLS}-{DA}. These methods can be said to be particularly appropriate for the analysis of large, highly-complex data sets which are common output(s) in metabolomics studies where the numbers of variables often far exceed the number of samples. In addition, these alternative techniques may be useful tools for generating parsimonious models through feature selection and data reduction, as well as providing more propitious results. We sincerely hope that the general reader is left with little doubt that there are several promising and readily available alternatives to {PLS}-{DA}, to analyze large and highly complex data sets.

abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of {1H} {NMR} metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: A major problem for current peak detection algorithms is that noise in mass spectrometry ({MS}) spectra gives rise to a high rate of false positives. The false positive rate is especially problematic in detecting peaks with low amplitudes. Usually, various baseline correction algorithms and smoothing methods are applied before attempting peak detection. This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods. {RESULTS}: Most peak detection algorithms simply identify peaks based on amplitude, ignoring the additional information present in the shape of the peaks in a spectrum. In our experience, 'true' peaks have characteristic shapes, and providing a shape-matching function that provides a 'goodness of fit' coefficient should provide a more robust peak identification method. Based on these observations, a continuous wavelet transform ({CWT})-based peak detection algorithm has been devised that identifies peaks with different scales and amplitudes. By transforming the spectrum into wavelet space, the pattern-matching problem is simplified and in addition provides a powerful technique for identifying and separating the signal from the spike noise and colored noise. This transformation, with the additional information provided by the {2D} {CWT} coefficients can greatly enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, with this technique no baseline removal or peak smoothing preprocessing steps are required before peak detection, and this improves the robustness of peak detection under a variety of conditions. The algorithm was evaluated with {SELDI}-{TOF} spectra with known polypeptide positions. Comparisons with two other popular algorithms were performed. The results show the {CWT}-based algorithm can identify both strong and weak peaks while keeping false positive rate low. {AVAILABILITY}: The algorithm is implemented in R and will be included as an open source module in the Bioconductor project.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) is a robust platform for the profiling of certain classes of small molecules in biological samples. When multiple samples are profiled, including replicates of the same sample and/or different sample states, one needs to account for retention time drifts between experiments. This can be achieved either by the alignment of chromatographic profiles prior to peak detection, or by matching signal peaks after they have been extracted from chromatogram data matrices. Automated retention time correction is particularly important in non-targeted profiling studies. {RESULTS}: A new approach for matching signal peaks based on dynamic programming is presented. The proposed approach relies on both peak retention times and mass spectra. The alignment of more than two peak lists involves three steps: (1) all possible pairs of peak lists are aligned, and similarity of each pair of peak lists is estimated; (2) the guide tree is built based on the similarity between the peak lists; (3) peak lists are progressively aligned starting with the two most similar peak lists, following the guide tree until all peak lists are exhausted. When two or more experiments are performed on different sample states and each consisting of multiple replicates, peak lists within each set of replicate experiments are aligned first (within-state alignment), and subsequently the resulting alignments are aligned themselves (between-state alignment). When more than two sets of replicate experiments are present, the between-state alignment also employs the guide tree. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach on {GC}-{MS} metabolic profiling experiments acquired on wild-type and mutant Leishmania mexicana parasites. {CONCLUSION}: We propose a progressive method to match signal peaks across multiple {GC}-{MS} experiments based on dynamic programming. A sensitive peak similarity function is proposed to balance peak retention time and peak mass spectra similarities. This approach can produce the optimal alignment between an arbitrary number of peak lists, and models explicitly within-state and between-state peak alignment. The accuracy of the proposed method was close to the accuracy of manually-curated peak matching, which required tens of man-hours for the analyzed data sets. The proposed approach may offer significant advantages for processing of high-throughput metabolomics data, especially when large numbers of experimental replicates and multiple sample states are analyzed.}

The ideal feature selection method should select the complete list of discriminating features that are related to the spiked peptides without selecting unrelated features. Whereas many studies have to rely on classification error to judge the reliability of the selected biomarker candidates, we assessed the accuracy of selection directly from the list of spiked peptides. The feature selection methods were applied to data sets with different sample sizes and extents of sample class separation determined by the concentration level of spiked compounds. For each feature selection method and data set, the performance for selecting a set of features related to spiked compounds was assessed using the harmonic mean of the recall and the precision (f-score) and the geometric mean of the recall and the true negative rate (g-score). We conclude that the univariate t test and the mww test with multiple testing corrections are not applicable to data sets with small sample sizes (n = 6), but their performance improves markedly with increasing sample size up to a point (n \textgreater 12) at which they outperform the other methods. {PCDA} and {PLSDA} select small feature sets with high precision but miss many true positive features related to the spiked peptides. {NSC} strikes a reasonable compromise between recall and precision for all data sets independent of spiking level and number of samples. Linear {SVM}-{RFE} performs poorly for selecting features related to the spiked compounds, even though the classification error is relatively low.}

abstract = {The exposome is defined as the totality of all human environmental exposures from conception to death. It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The 'toxic exposome' is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database ({T3DB}--www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of {T3DB} contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of {T3DB} has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds (\textgreater3600), targets (\textgreater2000) and gene expression datasets (\textgreater15,000 genes). It now includes extensive data on 'normal' toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential {NMR}, {MS}/{MS} and {GC}-{MS} spectra. This manuscript describes the most recent update to the {T3DB}, which was previously featured in the 2010 {NAR} Database Issue. \copyright The Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {Glandular trichomes are metabolic cell factories with the capacity to produce large quantities of secondary metabolites. Little is known about the connection between central carbon metabolism and metabolic productivity for secondary metabolites in glandular trichomes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we performed comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and {13C}-labeling of type {VI} glandular trichomes and leaves from a cultivated (Solanum lycopersicum {LA4024}) and a wild (Solanum habrochaites {LA1777}) tomato accession. Specific features of glandular trichomes that drive the formation of secondary metabolites could be identified. Tomato type {VI} trichomes are photosynthetic but acquire their carbon essentially from leaf sucrose. The energy and reducing power from photosynthesis are used to support the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, while the comparatively reduced Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle activity may be involved in recycling metabolic {CO2} Glandular trichomes cope with oxidative stress by producing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, oxylipins, and glutathione. Finally, distinct mechanisms are present in glandular trichomes to increase the supply of precursors for the isoprenoid pathways. Particularly, the citrate-malate shuttle supplies cytosolic acetyl-{CoA} and plastidic glycolysis and malic enzyme support the formation of plastidic pyruvate. A model is proposed on how glandular trichomes achieve high metabolic productivity. \copyright 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry has become one of the analytical platforms of choice for metabolomics studies. However, {LC}-{MS} metabolomics data can suffer from the effects of various systematic biases. These include batch effects, day-to-day variations in instrument performance, signal intensity loss due to time-dependent effects of the {LC} column performance, accumulation of contaminants in the {MS} ion source and {MS} sensitivity among others. In this study we aimed to test a singular value decomposition-based method, called {EigenMS}, for normalization of metabolomics data. We analyzed a clinical human dataset where {LC}-{MS} serum metabolomics data and physiological measurements were collected from thirty nine healthy subjects and forty with type 2 diabetes and applied {EigenMS} to detect and correct for any systematic bias. {EigenMS} works in several stages. First, {EigenMS} preserves the treatment group differences in the metabolomics data by estimating treatment effects with an {ANOVA} model (multiple fixed effects can be estimated). Singular value decomposition of the residuals matrix is then used to determine bias trends in the data. The number of bias trends is then estimated via a permutation test and the effects of the bias trends are eliminated. {EigenMS} removed bias of unknown complexity from the {LC}-{MS} metabolomics data, allowing for increased sensitivity in differential analysis. Moreover, normalized samples better correlated with both other normalized samples and corresponding physiological data, such as blood glucose level, glycated haemoglobin, exercise central augmentation pressure normalized to heart rate of 75, and total cholesterol. We were able to report 2578 discriminatory metabolite peaks in the normalized data (p\textless 0.05) as compared to only 1840 metabolite signals in the raw data. Our results support the use of singular value decomposition-based normalization for metabolomics data.}

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) is the most widely used analytical technology for metabolomic analysis of compounds that are volatile or can be chemically derivatised into volatile compounds. Unfortunately, data processing and analysis are not straightforward and the field is dominated by vendor-supplied software that does not always allow easy integration for large laboratories with different instruments. This paper presents an open-source pipeline for high-throughput {GC}-{MS} data processing, written in the R language and available as package {metaMS}. It features rapid annotation using in-house databases, and also provides support for building and validating such databases. The results are presented in simple-to-use tables, summarising the relative concentrations of identified compounds and unknowns in all samples.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biological pathways are descriptive diagrams of biological processes widely used for functional analysis of differentially expressed genes or proteins. Primary data analysis, such as quality control, normalisation, and statistical analysis, is often performed in scripting languages like R, Perl, and Python. Subsequent pathway analysis is usually performed using dedicated external applications. Workflows involving manual use of multiple environments are time consuming and error prone. Therefore, tools are needed that enable pathway analysis directly within the same scripting languages used for primary data analyses. Existing tools have limited capability in terms of available pathway content, pathway editing and visualisation options, and export file formats. Consequently, making the full-fledged pathway analysis tool {PathVisio} available from various scripting languages will benefit researchers. {RESULTS}: We developed {PathVisioRPC}, an {XMLRPC} interface for the pathway analysis software {PathVisio}. {PathVisioRPC} enables creating and editing biological pathways, visualising data on pathways, performing pathway statistics, and exporting results in several image formats in multiple programming environments. We demonstrate {PathVisioRPC} functionalities using examples in Python. Subsequently, we analyse a publicly available {NCBI} {GEO} gene expression dataset studying tumour bearing mice treated with cyclophosphamide in R. The R scripts demonstrate how calls to existing R packages for data processing and calls to {PathVisioRPC} can directly work together. To further support R users, we have created {RPathVisio} simplifying the use of {PathVisioRPC} in this environment. We have also created a pathway module for the microarray data analysis portal {ArrayAnalysis}.org that calls the {PathVisioRPC} interface to perform pathway analysis. This module allows users to use {PathVisio} functionality online without having to download and install the software and exemplifies how the {PathVisioRPC} interface can be used by data analysis pipelines for functional analysis of processed genomics data. {CONCLUSIONS}: {PathVisioRPC} enables data visualisation and pathway analysis directly from within various analytical environments used for preliminary analyses. It supports the use of existing pathways from {WikiPathways} or pathways created using the {RPC} itself. It also enables automation of tasks performed using {PathVisio}, making it useful to {PathVisio} users performing repeated visualisation and analysis tasks. {PathVisioRPC} is freely available for academic and commercial use at http://projects.bigcat.unimaas.nl/pathvisiorpc.}

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics often results in the observation of hundreds to thousands of features that are differentially regulated between sample classes. A major challenge in interpreting the data is distinguishing metabolites that are causally associated with the phenotype of interest from those that are unrelated but altered in downstream pathways as an effect. To facilitate this distinction, here we describe new software called {metaXCMS} for performing second-order ("meta") analysis of untargeted metabolomics data from multiple sample groups representing different models of the same phenotype. While the original version of {XCMS} was designed for the direct comparison of two sample groups, {metaXCMS} enables meta-analysis of an unlimited number of sample classes to facilitate prioritization of the data and increase the probability of identifying metabolites causally related to the phenotype of interest. {metaXCMS} is used to import {XCMS} results that are subsequently filtered, realigned, and ultimately compared to identify shared metabolites that are up- or down-regulated across all sample groups. We demonstrate the software's utility by identifying histamine as a metabolite that is commonly altered in three different models of pain. {metaXCMS} is freely available at http://metlin.scripps.edu/metaxcms/.}

abstract = {Metabolomics is a key approach in modern functional genomics and systems biology. Due to the complexity of metabolomics data, the variety of experimental designs, and the multiplicity of bioinformatics tools, providing experimenters with a simple and efficient resource to conduct comprehensive and rigorous analysis of their data is of utmost importance. In 2014, we launched the {Workflow4Metabolomics} ({W4M}; http://workflow4metabolomics.org) online infrastructure for metabolomics built on the Galaxy environment, which offers user-friendly features to build and run data analysis workflows including preprocessing, statistical analysis, and annotation steps. Here we present the new {W4M} 3.0 release, which contains twice as many tools as the first version, and provides two features which are, to our knowledge, unique among online resources. First, data from the four major metabolomics technologies (i.e., {LC}-{MS}, {FIA}-{MS}, {GC}-{MS}, and {NMR}) can be analyzed on a single platform. By using three studies in human physiology, alga evolution, and animal toxicology, we demonstrate how the 40 available tools can be easily combined to address biological issues. Second, the full analysis (including the workflow, the parameter values, the input data and output results) can be referenced with a permanent digital object identifier ({DOI}). Publication of data analyses is of major importance for robust and reproducible science. Furthermore, the publicly shared workflows are of high-value for e-learning and training. The {Workflow4Metabolomics} 3.0 e-infrastructure thus not only offers a unique online environment for analysis of data from the main metabolomics technologies, but it is also the first reference repository for metabolomics workflows.

The large amount of spectral information collected in one full-scan {MS} run demands the use of automated evaluation of recorded data files. We evaluated the applicability of the freeware deconvolution software {AMDIS} (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System) for {GC}-{MS}-based systematic toxicological analysis in urine for increasing the speed of evaluation and automating the daily routine workload. {METHODS}: We prepared a set of 111 urine samples for {GC}-{MS} analysis by acidic hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and acetylation. After analysis, the resulting data files were evaluated manually by an experienced toxicologist and automatically using {AMDIS} with deconvolution and identification settings previously optimized for this type of analysis. The results by manual and {AMDIS} evaluation were then compared. {RESULTS}: The deconvolution settings for the {AMDIS} evaluation were successfully optimized to obtain the highest possible number of components. Identification settings were evaluated and chosen for a compromise between most identified targets and general number of hits. With the use of these optimized settings, {AMDIS}-based data analysis was comparable or even superior to manual evaluation and reduced by half the overall analysis time. {CONCLUSIONS}: {AMDIS} proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for daily routine and emergency toxicology. Nevertheless, {AMDIS} can identify only targets present in the user-defined target library and may therefore not indicate unknown compounds that might be relevant in clinical and forensic toxicology.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible. {RESULTS}: We have developed a comprehensive, flexible, and computable, purely structure-based chemical taxonomy ({ChemOnt}), along with a computer program ({ClassyFire}) that uses only chemical structures and structural features to automatically assign all known chemical compounds to a taxonomy consisting of \textgreater4800 different categories. This new chemical taxonomy consists of up to 11 different levels (Kingdom, {SuperClass}, Class, {SubClass}, etc.) with each of the categories defined by unambiguous, computable structural rules. Furthermore each category is named using a consensus-based nomenclature and described (in English) based on the characteristic common structural properties of the compounds it contains. The {ClassyFire} webserver is freely accessible at http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/. Moreover, a Ruby {API} version is available at https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/classyfire\_api, which provides programmatic access to the {ClassyFire} server and database. {ClassyFire} has been used to annotate over 77 million compounds and has already been integrated into other software packages to automatically generate textual descriptions for, and/or infer biological properties of over 100,000 compounds. Additional examples and applications are provided in this paper. {CONCLUSION}: {ClassyFire}, in combination with {ChemOnt} ({ClassyFire}'s comprehensive chemical taxonomy), now allows chemists and cheminformaticians to perform large-scale, rapid and automated chemical classification. Moreover, a freely accessible {API} allows easy access to more than 77 million "{ClassyFire}" classified compounds. The results can be used to help annotate well studied, as well as lesser-known compounds. In addition, these chemical classifications can be used as input for data integration, and many other cheminformatics-related tasks.}

As a consequence, characterization of the variations of the urine metabolome under basal conditions becomes critical in order to avoid confounding effects in cohort studies. Such physiological information is however very scarce in the literature and in metabolomics databases so far. Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index ({BMI}), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares ({OPLS}), which we made available to the metabolomics community within the online {Workflow4Metabolomics}.org resource. We found 108 urine metabolites displaying concentration variations with either age, {BMI}, or gender, by integrating the results from univariate p-values and multivariate variable importance in projection ({VIP}). Several metabolite clusters were further evidenced by correlation analysis, and they allowed stratification of the cohort. In conclusion, our study highlights the impact of gender and age on the urinary metabolome, and thus it indicates that these factors should be taken into account for the design of metabolomics studies.}

abstract = {Due to their sensitivity and speed, mass-spectrometry based analytical technologies are widely used to in metabolomics to characterize biological phenomena. To address issues like metadata organization, quality assessment, data processing, data storage, and, finally, submission to public repositories, bioinformatic pipelines of a non-interactive nature are often employed, complementing the interactive software used for initial inspection and visualization of the data. These pipelines often are created as open-source software allowing the complete and exhaustive documentation of each step, ensuring the reproducibility of the analysis of extensive and often expensive experiments. In this paper, we will review the major steps which constitute such a data processing pipeline, discussing them in the context of an open-source software for untargeted {MS}-based metabolomics experiments recently developed at our institute. The software has been developed by integrating our {metaMS} R package with a user-friendly web-based application written in Grails. {MetaMS} takes care of data pre-processing and annotation, while the interface deals with the creation of the sample lists, the organization of the data storage, and the generation of survey plots for quality assessment. Experimental and biological metadata are stored in the {ISA}-Tab format making the proposed pipeline fully integrated with the Metabolights framework.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The in silico fragmenter {MetFrag}, launched in 2010, was one of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has {MetFrag} itself. This article details the latest developments to {MetFrag} and its use in small molecule identification since the original publication. {RESULTS}: {MetFrag} has gone through algorithmic and scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source and patent information via {ChemSpider} and {PubChem} web services, as well as {InChIKey} filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists". Retention time information can now be calculated either within {MetFrag} with a sufficient amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to {MetFrag} were evaluated on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem mass spectra ({HR}-{MS}/{MS}) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter, {CFM}-{ID}. Using {HR}-{MS}/{MS} information only, {MetFrag2}.2 and {CFM}-{ID} had 30 and 43 Top 1 ranks, respectively, using {PubChem} as a database. Including reference and retention information in {MetFrag2}.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top 1 ranks with {ChemSpider} and {PubChem} (89 and 71 \%), respectively, and even up to 343 Top 1 ranks ({PubChem}) when combining with {CFM}-{ID}. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using three additional datasets of 824 merged {HR}-{MS}/{MS} spectra in total. Further examples are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. {CONCLUSIONS}: In many cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates. The results achieved with {MetFrag2}.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command line version of {MetFrag2}.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/{MetFrag}/ is welcome.}

Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a 'molecular signature') to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of 'omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce {mixOmics}, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous 'omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure ({PLS}) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple 'omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A large proportion of polar anthropogenic compounds routinely released into the environment comprises homologue series, i.e., sets of chemicals differing in a repeating chemical unit. Using analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry ({LC}-{HRMS}), these compounds are readily measurable as signal sets with characteristic differences in mass and typically retention time. However, and despite such distinct characteristics, no computational approach for the direct, simultaneous and untargeted detection of all such signal sets comprising both {LC} and {HRMS} information has to date been presented. {RESULTS}: A fast two-staged approach has been developed to extract {LC}-{HRMS} signal patterns which can be indicative of homologous analytes. In a first stage, a k-d tree representation of picked {LC}-{HRMS} peaks is used to extract all feasible 3-tuples of peaks with restrictions in, e.g., mass defect differences. A second stage then recombines these 3-tuples to larger series tuples while ensuring smooth changes in their retention time characteristics. This unsupervised approach was evaluated for ten effluent samples from Swiss sewage treatment plants ({STPs}), in both positive and negative electrospray-ionization. {CONCLUSIONS}: Beside recovering all continuous series of previously identified homologues, substantial fractions of nontargeted peaks could subsequently be assigned into very diverse peak series, although assignments were often not unique. The latter ambiguities were resolved by a self-organizing map technique and revealed both distinctive series meshing and rivaling combinatorial solutions in the presence of isobaric or gapped series peaks. When comparing {STPs}, several ubiquitous yet partially low-frequent series mass differences emerged and may prioritize future identification efforts. The presented algorithm is freely available as part of the R package nontarget and as a user-friendly web-interface at www.envihomolog.eawag.ch.Graphical {AbstractSearch} for systematic series indicative of homologous compounds is based on a partitioned representation of {LC}-{HRMS} signal characteristics. This nontargeted search first extracts series triplets in a nearest-neighbour walk and then recombines them to larger ones. For illustration, the two dimensions involving mass defect characteristics are represented by one only.}

We first summarize the addition of new functionality, such atom typing and molecular formula handling, and improvement to existing functionality that has led to significantly better performance for substructure searching, molecular fingerprints, and rendering of molecules. Second, we outline how the {CDK} has evolved with respect to quality control and the approaches we have adopted to ensure stability, including a code review mechanism. {CONCLUSIONS}: This paper highlights our continued efforts to provide a community driven, open source cheminformatics library, and shows that such collaborative projects can thrive over extended periods of time, resulting in a high-quality and performant library.

The diversity of experimental designs and instrumental technologies used for metabolomics has led to the need for distinct data analysis methods and the development of many software tools. {OBJECTIVES}: To compile a comprehensive list of the most widely used freely available software and tools that are used primarily in metabolomics. {METHODS}: The most widely used tools were selected for inclusion in the review by either ≥ 50 citations on Web of Science (as of 08/09/16) or the use of the tool being reported in the recent Metabolomics Society survey. Tools were then categorised by the type of instrumental data (i.e. {LC}-{MS}, {GC}-{MS} or {NMR}) and the functionality (i.e. pre- and post-processing, statistical analysis, workflow and other functions) they are designed for. {RESULTS}: A comprehensive list of the most used tools was compiled. Each tool is discussed within the context of its application domain and in relation to comparable tools of the same domain. An extended list including additional tools is available at https://github.com/{RASpicer}/{MetabolomicsTools} which is classified and searchable via a simple controlled vocabulary. {CONCLUSION}: This review presents the most widely used tools for metabolomics analysis, categorised based on their main functionality.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Untargeted metabolomics generates a huge amount of data. Software packages for automated data processing are crucial to successfully process these data. A variety of such software packages exist, but the outcome of data processing strongly depends on algorithm parameter settings. If they are not carefully chosen, suboptimal parameter settings can easily lead to biased results. Therefore, parameter settings also require optimization. Several parameter optimization approaches have already been proposed, but a software package for parameter optimization which is free of intricate experimental labeling steps, fast and widely applicable is still missing. {RESULTS}: We implemented the software package {IPO} ('Isotopologue Parameter Optimization') which is fast and free of labeling steps, and applicable to data from different kinds of samples and data from different methods of liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry and data from different instruments. {IPO} optimizes {XCMS} peak picking parameters by using natural, stable (13)C isotopic peaks to calculate a peak picking score. Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing relative retention time differences within peak groups. Grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing the number of peak groups that show one peak from each injection of a pooled sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiments, and the resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models. {IPO} was tested on three different data sets, each consisting of a training set and test set. {IPO} resulted in an increase of reliable groups (146\% - 361\%), a decrease of non-reliable groups (3\% - 8\%) and a decrease of the retention time deviation to one third. {CONCLUSIONS}: {IPO} was successfully applied to data derived from liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry from three studies with different sample types and different chromatographic methods and devices. We were also able to show the potential of {IPO} to increase the reliability of metabolomics data. The source code is implemented in R, tested on Linux and Windows and it is freely available for download at https://github.com/glibiseller/{IPO} .

abstract = {Metabolomic data are frequently acquired using chromatographically coupled mass spectrometry ({MS}) platforms. For such datasets, the first step in data analysis relies on feature detection, where a feature is defined by a mass and retention time. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. Here, we report a novel feature grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from {MS} data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon. We additionally address a fundamental bottleneck in metabolomics, annotation of {MS} level signals, by incorporating indiscriminant {MS}/{MS} ({idMS}/{MS}) data implicitly: feature detection is performed on both {MS} and {idMS}/{MS} data, and feature-feature relationships are determined simultaneously from the {MS} and {idMS}/{MS} data. This approach facilitates identification of metabolites using in-source {MS} and/or {idMS}/{MS} spectra from a single experiment, reduces quantitative analytical variation compared to single-feature measures, and decreases false positive annotations of unpredictable phenomenon as novel compounds. This tool is released as a freely available R package, called {RAMClustR}, and is sufficiently versatile to group features from any chromatographic-spectrometric platform or feature-finding software.}

abstract = {High accuracy, high resolution tandem mass spectrometry ({MS}/{MS}) is becoming more common in analytical applications, yet databases of these spectra remain limited. Databases require good quality spectra with sufficient compound information, but processing, calibration, noise reduction and retrieval of compound information are time-consuming tasks that prevent many contributions. We present a comprehensive workflow for the automatic processing of {MS}/{MS} using formula annotation for recalibration and cleanup to generate high quality spectra of standard compounds for upload to {MassBank} (www.massbank.jp). Compound information is retrieved via Internet services. Reference standards of 70 pesticides were measured at various collision energies on an {LTQ}-Orbitrap {XL} to develop and evaluate the workflow. A total of 944 resulting spectra are now available on {MassBank}. Evidence of nitrogen adduct formation during {MS}/{MS} fragmentation processes was found, highlighting the benefits high accuracy {MS}/{MS} offers for spectral interpretation. A database of recalibrated, cleaned-up spectra resulted in the most correct spectra ranked in first place, regardless of whether the search spectra were recalibrated or not, whereas the average rank of the correct molecular formula was improved from 2.55 (uncalibrated) to 1.53 when using recalibrated {MS}/{MS} data. The workflow is available as an R package {RMassBank} capable of generating {MassBank} records from raw {MS} and {MS}/{MS} data and can be adjusted to process data acquired with different settings and instruments. This workflow is a vital step towards addressing the need for more high quality, high accuracy {MS}/{MS} spectra in spectral databases and provides important information for spectral interpretation.

abstract = {Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}) has been a long-standing approach used for identifying small molecules due to the highly reproducible ionization process of electron impact ionization ({EI}). However, the use of {GC}-{EI} {MS} in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex data sets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information on metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce {eRah}, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of {GC}/{MS} chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance ({CMLC}) and orthogonal signal deconvolution ({OSD}), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. {eRah} outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of {eRah} are demonstrated by the analysis of {GC}-time-of-flight ({TOF}) {MS} data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of {eRah} are compared to {centWave}, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used {XCMS} package, {MetAlign}, and {ChromaTOF} software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by {GC}-triple quadrupole ({QqQ}) {MS}, {LC}-{QqQ}, and {NMR}. {eRah} is freely available at http://{CRAN}.R-project.org/package=erah .}

abstract = {Motivation: Flow Injection Analysis coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry ({FIA}-{HRMS}) is a promising approach for high-throughput metabolomics. {FIA}-{HRMS} data, however, cannot be preprocessed with current software tools which rely on liquid chromatography separation, or handle low resolution data only. Results: We thus developed the {proFIA} package, which implements a suite of innovative algorithms to preprocess {FIA}-{HRMS} raw files, and generates the table of peak intensities. The workflow consists of 3 steps: (i) noise estimation, peak detection and quantification, (ii) peak grouping across samples and (iii) missing value imputation. In addition, we have implemented a new indicator to quantify the potential alteration of the feature peak shape due to matrix effect. The preprocessing is fast (less than 15 s per file), and the value of the main parameters (ppm and dmz) can be easily inferred from the mass resolution of the instrument. Application to two metabolomics datasets (including spiked serum samples) showed high precision (96\%) and recall (98\%) compared with manual integration. These results demonstrate that {proFIA} achieves very efficient and robust detection and quantification of {FIA}-{HRMS} data, and opens new opportunities for high-throughput phenotyping. Availability and implementation: The {proFIA} software (as well as the {plasFIA} dataset) is available as an R package on the Bioconductor repository (http://bioconductor.org/packages/{proFIA}), and as a Galaxy module on the Main Toolshed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu), and on the {Workflow4Metabolomics} online infrastructure (http://workflow4metabolomics.org).

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) is a commonly used technique in untargeted metabolomics owing to broad coverage of metabolites, high sensitivity and simple sample preparation. However, data generated from multiple batches are affected by measurement errors inherent to alterations in signal intensity, drift in mass accuracy and retention times between samples both within and between batches. These measurement errors reduce repeatability and reproducibility and may thus decrease the power to detect biological responses and obscure interpretation. {OBJECTIVE}: Our aim was to develop procedures to address and correct for within- and between-batch variability in processing multiple-batch untargeted {LC}-{MS} metabolomics data to increase their quality. {METHODS}: Algorithms were developed for: (i) alignment and merging of features that are systematically misaligned between batches, through aggregating feature presence/missingness on batch level and combining similar features orthogonally present between batches; and (ii) within-batch drift correction using a cluster-based approach that allows multiple drift patterns within batch. Furthermore, a heuristic criterion was developed for the feature-wise choice of reference-based or population-based between-batch normalisation. {RESULTS}: In authentic data, between-batch alignment resulted in picking 15 \% more features and deconvoluting 15 \% of features previously erroneously aligned. Within-batch correction provided a decrease in median quality control feature coefficient of variation from 20.5 to 15.1 \%. Algorithms are open source and available as an R package ('{batchCorr}'). {CONCLUSIONS}: The developed procedures provide unbiased measures of improved data quality, with implications for improved data analysis. Although developed for {LC}-{MS} based metabolomics, these methods are generic and can be applied to other data suffering from similar limitations.}

It normalizes the data with 12 different normalization methods and generates a report with several quantitative and qualitative plots for comparative evaluation of different methods. The usefulness of Normalyzer is demonstrated with three different case studies from quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics.

Several artefacts have been identified during the acquisition step in large {LC}/{MS} metabolomics experiments, including ion suppression, carryover or changes in the sensitivity and intensity. Several sources have been pointed out as responsible for these effects. In this context, the drift effects of the peak intensity is one of the most frequent and may even constitute the main source of variance in the data, resulting in misleading statistical results when the samples are analysed. In this article, we propose the introduction of a methodology based on a common variance analysis before the data normalization to address this issue. This methodology was tested and compared with four other methods by calculating the Dunn and Silhouette indices of the quality control classes. The results showed that our proposed methodology performed better than any of the other four methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of approach has been applied in the metabolomics context. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The source code of the methods is available as the R package {intCor} at http://b2slab.upc.edu/software-and-downloads/intensity-drift-correction/. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2014.

Principal component analysis ({PCA}) is currently the most widely used statistical technique for analyzing metabolomic data. However, {PCA} is limited by the fact that it is not based on a statistical model. {RESULTS}: Here, probabilistic principal component analysis ({PPCA}) which addresses some of the limitations of {PCA}, is reviewed and extended. A novel extension of {PPCA}, called probabilistic principal component and covariates analysis ({PPCCA}), is introduced which provides a flexible approach to jointly model metabolomic data and additional covariate information. The use of a mixture of {PPCA} models for discovering the number of inherent groups in metabolomic data is demonstrated. The jackknife technique is employed to construct confidence intervals for estimated model parameters throughout. The optimal number of principal components is determined through the use of the Bayesian Information Criterion model selection tool, which is modified to address the high dimensionality of the data. {CONCLUSIONS}: The methods presented are illustrated through an application to metabolomic data sets. Jointly modeling metabolomic data and covariates was successfully achieved and has the potential to provide deeper insight to the underlying data structure. Examination of confidence intervals for the model parameters, such as loadings, allows for principled and clear interpretation of the underlying data structure. A software package called {MetabolAnalyze}, freely available through the R statistical software, has been developed to facilitate implementation of the presented methods in the metabolomics field.}

abstract = {High-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics show great promise for the discovery of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Selection of the most promising candidates between the initial untargeted step and the subsequent validation phases is critical within the pipeline leading to clinical tests. Several statistical and data mining methods have been described for feature selection: in particular, wrapper approaches iteratively assess the performance of the classifier on distinct subsets of variables. Current wrappers, however, do not estimate the significance of the selected features. We therefore developed a new methodology to find the smallest feature subset which significantly contributes to the model performance, by using a combination of resampling, ranking of variable importance, significance assessment by permutation of the feature values in the test subsets, and half-interval search. We wrapped our biosigner algorithm around three reference binary classifiers (Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) which have been shown to achieve specific performances depending on the structure of the dataset. By using three real biological and clinical metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (containing up to 7000 features), complementary signatures were obtained in a few minutes, generally providing higher prediction accuracies than the initial full model. Comparison with alternative feature selection approaches further indicated that our method provides signatures of restricted size and high stability. Finally, by using our methodology to seek metabolites discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetic patients, several features were selected, including a fragment from the taurochenodeoxycholic bile acid. Our methodology, implemented in the biosigner R/Bioconductor package and Galaxy/Workflow4metabolomics module, should be of interest for both experimenters and statisticians to identify robust molecular signatures from large omics datasets in the process of developing new diagnostics.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Reduction in the cost of genomic assays has generated large amounts of biomedical-related data. As a result, current studies perform multiple experiments in the same subjects. While Bioconductor's methods and classes implemented in different packages manage individual experiments, there is not a standard class to properly manage different omic datasets from the same subjects. In addition, most R/Bioconductor packages that have been designed to integrate and visualize biological data often use basic data structures with no clear general methods, such as subsetting or selecting samples. {RESULTS}: To cover this need, we have developed {MultiDataSet}, a new R class based on Bioconductor standards, designed to encapsulate multiple data sets. {MultiDataSet} deals with the usual difficulties of managing multiple and non-complete data sets while offering a simple and general way of subsetting features and selecting samples. We illustrate the use of {MultiDataSet} in three common situations: 1) performing integration analysis with third party packages; 2) creating new methods and functions for omic data integration; 3) encapsulating new unimplemented data from any biological experiment. {CONCLUSIONS}: {MultiDataSet} is a suitable class for data integration under R and Bioconductor framework.}

Apparent missingness can be due to true absence of the metabolite in the sample or presence at a level below detectability. Mixture-model analysis can formally account for metabolite 'missingness' due to absence or undetectability, but software for this type of analysis in the high-throughput setting is limited. The R package metabomxtr has been developed to facilitate mixture-model analysis of non-targeted metabolomics data in which only a portion of samples have quantifiable abundance for certain metabolites. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: metabomxtr is available through Bioconductor.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Data generated from metabolomics experiments are different from other types of "-omics" data. For example, a common phenomenon in mass spectrometry ({MS})-based metabolomics data is that the data matrix frequently contains missing values, which complicates some quantitative analyses. One way to tackle this problem is to treat them as absent. Hence there are two types of information that are available in metabolomics data: presence/absence of a metabolite and a quantitative value of the abundance level of a metabolite if it is present. Combining these two layers of information poses challenges to the application of traditional statistical approaches in differential expression analysis. {RESULTS}: In this article, we propose a novel kernel-based score test for the metabolomics differential expression analysis. In order to simultaneously capture both the continuous pattern and discrete pattern in metabolomics data, two new kinds of kernels are designed. One is the distance-based kernel and the other is the stratified kernel. While we initially describe the procedures in the case of single-metabolite analysis, we extend the methods to handle metabolite sets as well. {CONCLUSIONS}: Evaluation based on both simulated data and real data from a liver cancer metabolomics study indicates that our kernel method has a better performance than some existing alternatives. An implementation of the proposed kernel method in the R statistical computing environment is available at http://works.bepress.com/debashis\_ghosh/60/ .}

abstract = {A fast and memory-efficient calculation of theoretical isotope patterns is crucial for the routine interpretation of mass spectrometric data. For high-resolution experiments, calculations must procure the exact masses and probabilities of relevant isotopologues over a wide range of polyisotopic compounds, while pruning low-probable ones. Here, a novel albeit simple treelike structure is introduced to swiftly derive sets of relevant subisotopologues for each element in a molecule, which are then combined to the isotopologues of the full molecule. In contrast to existing approaches, transitions via single replacements of the most abundant isotope per element are used in separable tree branches to derive subisotopologues from each other. Moreover, the underlying transition trees prevent redundant replacements and permit the detection of the most probable isotopologue in a first phase. A relative threshold can then be exploited in a second parallelized phase for a precise prepruning of large fractions of the remaining subisotopologues. The gain in performance from such early pruning and the lower variation in the distortion of simulated data with use of relative rather than absolute thresholds were validated in a large-scale benchmark simulation, unprecedentedly comprising several thousand molecular formulas. Both the algorithm and a wealth of related features are freely available as R-package {enviPat} and as a user-friendly Web interface.}

abstract = {{RATIONALE}: A bottleneck in metabolic profiling of complex biological extracts is confident, non-supervised annotation of ideally all contained, chemically highly diverse small molecules. Recent computational strategies combining sum formula prediction with in silico fragmentation achieve confident de novo annotation, once the correct neutral mass of a compound is known. Current software solutions for automated adduct ion assignment, however, are either publicly unavailable or have been validated against only few experimental electrospray ionization ({ESI}) mass spectra. {METHODS}: We here present {findMAIN} (find Main Adduct {IoN}), a new heuristic approach for interpreting {ESI} mass spectra. {findMAIN} scores {MS1} spectra based on explained intensity, mass accuracy and isotope charge agreement of adducts and related ionization products and annotates peaks of the (de)protonated molecule and adduct ions. The approach was validated against 1141 {ESI} positive mode spectra of chemically diverse standard compounds acquired on different high-resolution mass spectrometric instruments (Orbitrap and time-of-flight). Robustness against impure spectra was evaluated. {RESULTS}: Correct adduct ion assignment was achieved for up to 83\% of the spectra. Performance was independent of compound class and mass spectrometric platform. The algorithm proved highly tolerant against spectral contamination as demonstrated exemplarily for co-eluting compounds as well as systematically by pairwise mixing of spectra. When used in conjunction with {MS}-{FINDER}, a state-of-the-art sum formula tool, correct sum formulas were obtained for 77\% of spectra. It outperformed both 'brute force' approaches and current state-of-the-art annotation packages tested as potential alternatives. Limitations of the heuristic pertained to poorly ionizing compounds and cationic compounds forming [M]+ ions. {CONCLUSIONS}: A new, validated approach for interpreting {ESI} mass spectra is presented, filling a gap in the nontargeted metabolomics workflow.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The ability to accurately measure structural similarities among small molecules is important for many analysis routines in drug discovery and chemical genomics. Algorithms used for this purpose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum common substructure ({MCS}) methods. {MCS} approaches provide one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect {MCSs}. To eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search method for identifying flexible {MCSs} ({FMCSs}) containing a user-definable number of atom and/or bond mismatches. {RESULTS}: The {fmcsR} package provides an R interface, with the time-consuming steps of the {FMCS} algorithm implemented in C++. It includes utilities for pairwise compound comparisons, structure similarity searching, clustering and visualization of {MCSs}. In comparison with an existing {MCS} tool, {fmcsR} shows better time performance over a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and the resulting {FMCSs} are often substantially larger than their strict {MCS} counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening ({VS}) tests, the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active structures at the top of {MCS}-based similarity search results. With respect to overall and early enrichment performance, {FMCS} outperforms most of the seven other {VS} methods considered in these tests. {AVAILABILITY}: {fmcsR} is freely available for all common operating systems from the Bioconductor site (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/{fmcsR}.html). {CONTACT}: thomas.girke@ucr.edu. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {Mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography has become the major technical platform in metabolomics. Aided by peak detection algorithms, the detected signals are characterized by mass-over-charge ratio (m/z) and retention time. Chemical identities often remain elusive for the majority of the signals. Multi-stage mass spectrometry based on electrospray ionization ({ESI}) allows collision-induced dissociation ({CID}) fragmentation of selected precursor ions. These fragment ions can assist in structural inference for metabolites of low molecular weight. Computational investigations of fragmentation spectra have increasingly received attention in metabolomics and various public databases house such data. We have developed an R package "iontree" that can capture, store and analyze {MS2} and {MS3} mass spectral data from high throughput metabolomics experiments. The package includes functions for ion tree construction, an algorithm ({distMS2}) for {MS2} spectral comparison, and tools for building platform-independent ion tree ({MS2}/{MS3}) libraries. We have demonstrated the utilization of the package for the systematic analysis and annotation of fragmentation spectra collected in various metabolomics platforms, including direct infusion mass spectrometry, and liquid chromatography coupled with either low resolution or high resolution mass spectrometry. Assisted by the developed computational tools, we have demonstrated that spectral trees can provide informative evidence complementary to retention time and accurate mass to aid with annotating unknown peaks. These experimental spectral trees once subjected to a quality control process, can be used for querying public {MS2} databases or de novo interpretation. The putatively annotated spectral trees can be readily incorporated into reference libraries for routine identification of metabolites.}

abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry ({MS}/{MS} or {MS2}) is a widely used approach for structural annotation and identification of metabolites in complex biological samples. The importance of assessing the contribution of the precursor ion within an isolation window for {MS2} experiments has been previously detailed in proteomics, where precursor ion purity influences the quality and accuracy of matching to mass spectral libraries, but to date, there has been little attention to this data-processing technique in metabolomics. Here, we present {msPurity}, a vendor-independent R package for liquid chromatography ({LC}) and direct infusion ({DI}) {MS2} that calculates a simple metric to describe the contribution of the selected precursor. The precursor purity metric is calculated as "intensity of a selected precursor divided by the summed intensity of the isolation window". The metric is interpolated at the recorded point of {MS2} acquisition using bordering full-scan spectra. Isotopic peaks of the selected precursor can be removed, and low abundance peaks that are believed to have limited contribution to the resulting {MS2} spectra are removed. Additionally, the isolation efficiency of the mass spectrometer can be taken into account. The package was applied to Data Dependent Acquisition ({DDA})-based {MS2} metabolomics data sets derived from three metabolomics data repositories. For the 10 {LC}-{MS2} {DDA} data sets with \textgreater ±1 Da isolation windows, the median precursor purity score ranged from 0.67 to 0.96 (scale = 0 to +1). The R package was also used to assess precursor purity of theoretical isolation windows from {LC}-{MS} data sets of differing sample types. The theoretical isolation windows being the same width used for an anticipated {DDA} experiment (±0.5 Da). The most complex sample had a median precursor purity score of 0.46 for the 64,498 {XCMS} determined features, in comparison to the less spectrally complex sample that had a purity score of 0.66 for 5071 {XCMS} features. It has been previously reported in proteomics that a purity score of \textless 0.5 can produce unreliable spectra matching results. With this assumption, we show that for complex samples there will be a large number of metabolites where traditional {DDA} approaches will struggle to provide reliable annotations or accurate matches to mass spectral libraries.}

However, as it happens with other omics data, the analysis of metabolomics datasets provides multiple challenges, both in terms of methodologies and in the development of appropriate computational tools. Indeed, from the available software tools, none addresses the multiplicity of existing techniques and data analysis tasks.

Built-in flexibility and implementation in the powerful R/Bioconductor framework allow key preprocessing steps such as peak alignment, normalization, or dimensionality reduction to be tailored to specific problems.

This has the effect that its data processing remains tedious and dependent on user interventions. As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for {NMR} spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze {1D} {NMR} spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping. This yields a matrix consisting of features, samples and peak values that can be conveniently processed either by using included multivariate statistical functions or by using many other recently developed methods for {NMR} data analysis. speaq 2.0 facilitates robust and high-throughput metabolomics based on {1D} {NMR} but is also compatible with other {NMR} frameworks or complementary {LC}-{MS} workflows. The methods are benchmarked using two publicly available datasets. speaq 2.0 is distributed through the existing speaq R package to provide a complete solution for {NMR} data processing. The package and the code for the presented case studies are freely available on {CRAN} (https://cran.r-project.org/package=speaq) and {GitHub} (https://github.com/beirnaert/speaq).}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) is one of the technologies widely used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of small molecules. In particular, {GC} coupled to single quadrupole {MS} can be utilized for targeted analysis by selected ion monitoring ({SIM}). However, to our knowledge, there are no software tools specifically designed for analysis of {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} data. In this paper, we introduce a new R/Bioconductor package called {SIMAT} for quantitative analysis of the levels of targeted analytes. {SIMAT} provides guidance in choosing fragments for a list of targets. This is accomplished through an optimization algorithm that has the capability to select the most appropriate fragments from overlapping chromatographic peaks based on a pre-specified library of background analytes. The tool also allows visualization of the total ion chromatograms ({TIC}) of runs and extracted ion chromatograms ({EIC}) of analytes of interest. Moreover, retention index ({RI}) calibration can be performed and raw {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} data can be imported in {netCDF} or {NIST} mass spectral library ({MSL}) formats. {RESULTS}: We evaluated the performance of {SIMAT} using two {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} datasets obtained by targeted analysis of: (1) plasma samples from 86 patients in a targeted metabolomic experiment; and (2) mixtures of internal standards spiked in plasma samples at varying concentrations in a method development study. Our results demonstrate that {SIMAT} offers alternative solutions to {AMDIS} and {MetaboliteDetector} to achieve accurate detection of targets and estimation of their relative intensities by analysis of {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} data. {CONCLUSIONS}: We introduce a new R package called {SIMAT} that allows the selection of the optimal set of fragments and retention time windows for target analytes in {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} based analysis. Also, various functions and algorithms are implemented in the tool to: (1) read and import raw data and spectral libraries; (2) perform {GC}-{SIM}-{MS} data preprocessing; and (3) plot and visualize {EICs} and {TICs}.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Accurate cross-sample peak alignment and reliable intensity normalization is a critical step for robust quantitative analysis in untargetted metabolomics since tandem mass spectrometry ({MS}/{MS}) is rarely used for compound identification. Therefore shortcomings in the data processing steps can easily introduce false positives due to misalignments and erroneous normalization adjustments in large sample studies. {RESULTS}: In this work, we developed a software package {MetTailor} featuring two novel data preprocessing steps to remedy drawbacks in the existing processing tools. First, we propose a novel dynamic block summarization ({DBS}) method for correcting misalignments from peak alignment algorithms, which alleviates missing data problem due to misalignments. For the purpose of verifying correct re-alignments, we propose to use the cross-sample consistency in isotopic intensity ratios as a quality metric. Second, we developed a flexible intensity normalization procedure that adjusts normalizing factors against the temporal variations in total ion chromatogram ({TIC}) along the chromatographic retention time ({RT}). We first evaluated the {DBS} algorithm using a curated metabolomics dataset, illustrating that the algorithm identifies misaligned peaks and correctly realigns them with good sensitivity. We next demonstrated the {DBS} algorithm and the {RT}-based normalization procedure in a large-scale dataset featuring \textgreater100 sera samples in primary Dengue infection study. Although the initial alignment was successful for the majority of peaks, the {DBS} algorithm still corrected ∼7000 misaligned peaks in this data and many recovered peaks showed consistent isotopic patterns with the peaks they were realigned to. In addition, the {RT}-based normalization algorithm efficiently removed visible local variations in {TIC} along the {RT}, without sacrificing the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed metabolites. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The R package {MetTailor} is freely available at the {SourceForge} website http://mettailor.sourceforge.net/. {CONTACT}: hyung\_won\_choi@nuhs.edu.sg {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2015.

For assessing the performance, we used real biological samples, Bacillus subtilis strains 168 and {MGB874}, in the positive mode by {LC}-orbitrap. For 14 identified compounds by measuring the authentic compounds, we compared obtained m/z values with other {LC}-{MS} processing tools. The errors by {AMDORAP} were distributed within ±3 ppm and showed the best performance in m/z value accuracy. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our method can detect m/z values of biological samples much more accurately than other {LC}-{MS} analysis tools. {AMDORAP} allows us to address the relationships between biological effects and cellular metabolites based on accurate m/z values.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis depends upon the identification of spectral peaks by their mass and retention time. Statistical analysis that follows the identification currently relies on one main peak of each compound. However, a compound present in the sample typically produces several spectral peaks due to its isotopic properties and the ionization process of the mass spectrometer device. In this work, we investigate the extent to which these additional peaks can be used to increase the statistical strength of differential analysis. {RESULTS}: We present a Bayesian approach for integrating data of multiple detected peaks that come from one compound. We demonstrate the approach through a simulated experiment and validate it on ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({UPLC}-{MS}) experiments for metabolomics and lipidomics. Peaks that are likely to be associated with one compound can be clustered by the similarity of their chromatographic shape. Changes of concentration between sample groups can be inferred more accurately when multiple peaks are available. {CONCLUSIONS}: When the sample-size is limited, the proposed multi-peak approach improves the accuracy at inferring covariate effects.

Here, we describe a lipidomics workflow and open-source software package for high-throughput annotation and putative identification of lipid, oxidized lipid, and oxylipin biomarkers in high-mass-accuracy {HPLC}-{MS} data. Lipid and oxylipin biomarker screening through adduct hierarchy sequences, or {LOBSTAHS}, uses orthogonal screening criteria based on adduct ion formation patterns and other properties to identify thousands of compounds while providing the user with a confidence score for each assignment. Assignments are made from one of two customizable databases; the default databases contain 14 068 unique entries. To demonstrate the software's functionality, we screened more than 340 000 mass spectral features from an experiment in which hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. {LOBSTAHS} putatively identified 1969 unique parent compounds in 21 869 features that survived the multistage screening process. While P. tricornutum maintained more than 92\% of its core lipidome under oxidative stress, patterns in biomarker distribution and abundance indicated remodeling was both subtle and pervasive. Treatment with 150 μM {H2O2} promoted statistically significant carbon-chain elongation across lipid classes, with the strongest elongation accompanying oxidation in moieties of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a lipid typically localized to the chloroplast. Oxidative stress also induced a pronounced reallocation of lipidome peak area to triacylglycerols. {LOBSTAHS} can be used with environmental or experimental data from a variety of systems and is freely available at https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/{LOBSTAHS} .}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Metabolomics is one of the most recent omics-technologies and uses robust analytical techniques to screen low molecular mass metabolites in biological samples. It has evolved very quickly during the last decade. However, metabolomics datasets are considered highly complex when used to relate metabolite levels to metabolic pathway activity. Despite recent developments in bioinformatics, which have improved the quality of metabolomics data, there is still no straightforward method capable of correlating metabolite level to the activity of different metabolic pathways operating within the cells. Thus, this kind of analysis still depends on extremely laborious and time-consuming processes. {RESULTS}: Here, we present a new algorithm Pathway Activity Profiling ({PAPi}) with which we are able to compare metabolic pathway activities from metabolite profiles. The applicability and potential of {PAPi} was demonstrated using a previously published data from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. {PAPi} was able to support the biological interpretations of the previously published observations and, in addition, generated new hypotheses in a straightforward manner. However, {PAPi} is time consuming to perform manually. Thus, we also present here a new R-software package ({PAPi}) which implements the {PAPi} algorithm and facilitates its usage to quickly compare metabolic pathways activities between different experimental conditions. Using the identified metabolites and their respective abundances as input, the {PAPi} package calculates pathways' Activity Scores, which represents the potential metabolic pathways activities and allows their comparison between conditions. {PAPi} also performs principal components analysis and analysis of variance or t-test to investigate differences in activity level between experimental conditions. In addition, {PAPi} generates comparative graphs highlighting up- and down-regulated pathway activity. {AVAILABILITY}: These datasets are available in http://www.4shared.com/file/{hTWyndYU}/extra.html and http://www.4shared.com/file/{VbQIIDeu}/intra.html. {PAPi} package is available in: http://www.4shared.com/file/{s0uIYWIg}/{PAPi\_10}.html {CONTACT}: s.villas-boas@auckland.ac.nz {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {The wide chemical diversity of metabolites present in biological samples hinders full characterization of their metabolomic profile by using a single analytical technique. However, {LC}–{MS} is a competitive technique for obtaining a comprehensive description of a wide range of metabolites by using a combination of the two ionization modes, positive and negative, the suitability of which for this purpose depends on the chemical structure of the particular metabolites. One of the main shortcomings of this approach is that it produces two independent data sets (one per polarity) that require two parallel data analyses to identify significant metabolites associated to the target biological effect. As a result, analyzing the data is a time-consuming step of metabolomic analysis. In this work, this shortcoming was overcome by developing a tool to combine the data matrices for the positive and negative ionization modes in {MS}. The most critical function of the tool is filtering off the molecular features of a given metabolite in whichever ionization mode they are detected with the less sensitivity in order to avoid using redundant information and complicating the statistical treatment as a result. The software allows the two data sets to be merged into a single one that can be statistically processed in the conventional metabolomics workflow. Its efficiency was assessed by application to data sets obtained from the analysis of human serum and urine.}

abstract = {Studying the flow of chemical moieties through the complex set of metabolic reactions that happen in the cell is essential to understanding the alterations in homeostasis that occur in disease. Recently, {LC}/{MS}-based untargeted metabolomics and isotopically labeled metabolites have been used to facilitate the unbiased mapping of labeled moieties through metabolic pathways. However, due to the complexity of the resulting experimental data sets few computational tools are available for data analysis. Here we introduce {geoRge}, a novel computational approach capable of analyzing untargeted {LC}/{MS} data from stable isotope-labeling experiments. {geoRge} is written in the open language R and runs on the output structure of the {XCMS} package, which is in widespread use. As opposed to the few existing tools, which use labeled samples to track stable isotopes by iterating over all {MS} signals using the theoretical mass difference between the light and heavy isotopes, {geoRge} uses unlabeled and labeled biologically equivalent samples to compare isotopic distributions in the mass spectra. Isotopically enriched compounds change their isotopic distribution as compared to unlabeled compounds. This is directly reflected in a number of new m/z peaks and higher intensity peaks in the mass spectra of labeled samples relative to the unlabeled equivalents. The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative quantification capabilities of {geoRge} are demonstrated by the analysis of {LC}/{MS} data from a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line ({ARPE}-19) grown on normal and high glucose concentrations mimicking diabetic retinopathy conditions in vitro. In addition, we compared the results of {geoRge} with the outcome of X(13){CMS}, since both approaches rely entirely on {XCMS} parameters for feature selection, namely m/z and retention time values. To ensure data traceability and reproducibility, and enabling for comparison with other existing and future approaches, raw {LC}/{MS} files have been deposited in {MetaboLights} ({MTBLS213}) and {geoRge} is available as an R script at https://github.com/jcapelladesto/{geoRge}.}

abstract = {Metabolomics {GC}-{MS} samples involve high complexity data that must be effectively resolved to produce chemically meaningful results. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares ({MCR}-{ALS}) is the most frequently reported technique for that purpose. More recently, independent component analysis ({ICA}) has been reported as an alternative to {MCR}. Those algorithms attempt to infer a model describing the observed data and, therefore, the least squares regression used in {MCR} assumes that the data is a linear combination of that model. However, due to the high complexity of real data, the construction of a model to describe optimally the observed data is a critical step and these algorithms should prevent the influence from outlier data. This study proves independent component regression ({ICR}) as an alternative for {GC}-{MS} compound identification. Both {ICR} and {MCR} though require least squares regression to correctly resolve the mixtures. In this paper, a novel orthogonal signal deconvolution ({OSD}) approach is introduced, which uses principal component analysis to determine the compound spectra. The study includes a compound identification comparison between the results by {ICA}-{OSD}, {MCR}-{OSD}, {ICR} and {MCR}-{ALS} using pure standards and human serum samples. Results shows that {ICR} may be used as an alternative to multivariate curve methods, as {ICR} efficiency is comparable to {MCR}-{ALS}. Also, the study demonstrates that the proposed {OSD} approach achieves greater spectral resolution accuracy than the traditional least squares approach when compounds elute under undue interference of biological matrices.

The algorithm first performs baseline correction and denoising simultaneously using the {NEB} model, which also defines peak regions. Peaks are then picked using a mixture of probability distribution to deal with the co-eluting peaks. Peak merging is further carried out based on the mass spectral similarities among the peaks within the same peak group. The algorithm is evaluated using experimental data to study the effect of different cut-offs of the conditional Bayes factors and the effect of different mixture models including Poisson, truncated Gaussian, Gaussian, Gamma, and exponentially modified Gaussian ({EMG}) distributions, and the optimal version is introduced using a trial-and-error approach. We then compare the new algorithm with two existing algorithms in terms of compound identification. Data analysis shows that the developed algorithm can detect the peaks with lower false discovery rates than the existing algorithms, and a less complicated peak picking model is a promising alternative to the more complicated and widely used {EMG} mixture models.}

To overcome the limitations of the current alignment methods, we developed an optimal peak alignment using a novel mixture similarity by employing the peak distance and the spectral similarity measures simultaneously without any variation windows. In addition, we examined the effect of the four different distance measures such as Euclidean, Maximum, Manhattan and Canberra distances on the peak alignment. The performance of our proposed peak alignment algorithm was compared with the existing alignment methods on the two sets of {GC} × {GC}-{MS} data. Our analysis showed that Canberra distance performed better than other distances and the proposed mixture similarity peak alignment algorithm prevailed against all literature reported methods. {AVAILABILITY}: The data and software {mSPA} are available at http://stage.louisville.edu/faculty/x0zhan17/software/software-development.}

abstract = {Missing values exist widely in mass-spectrometry ({MS}) based metabolomics data. Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random ({MNAR}), missing at random ({MAR}), and missing completely at random ({MCAR}). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum ({HM}), mean, median, random forest ({RF}), singular value decomposition ({SVD}), k-nearest neighbors ({kNN}), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data ({QRILC})) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error ({NRMSE}) and {NRMSE}-based sum of ranks ({SOR}) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis ({PCA})/partial least squares ({PLS})-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student's t-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that {RF} performed the best for {MCAR}/{MAR} and {QRILC} was the favored one for left-censored {MNAR}. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics ( https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/{MetImp}/ ).}

abstract = {Desorption electrospray ionization ({DESI}) mass spectrometry ({MS}) was used in an imaging mode to interrogate the lipid profiles of thin tissue sections of 11 sample pairs of human papillary renal cell carcinoma ({RCC}) and adjacent normal tissue and nine sample pairs of clear cell {RCC} and adjacent normal tissue. {DESI}-{MS} images showing the spatial distributions of particular glycerophospholipids ({GPs}) and free fatty acids in the negative ion mode were compared to serial tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E). Increased absolute intensities as well as changes in relative abundance were seen for particular compounds in the tumor regions of the samples. Multivariate statistical analysis using orthogonal projection to latent structures treated partial least square discriminate analysis ({PLS}-{DA}) was used for visualization and classification of the tissue pairs using the full mass spectra as predictors. {PLS}-{DA} successfully distinguished tumor from normal tissue for both papillary and clear cell {RCC} with misclassification rates obtained from the validation set of 14.3\% and 7.8\%, respectively. It was also used to distinguish papillary and clear cell {RCC} from each other and from the combined normal tissues with a reasonable misclassification rate of 23\%, as determined from the validation set. Overall {DESI}-{MS} imaging combined with multivariate statistical analysis shows promise as a molecular pathology technique for diagnosing cancerous and normal tissue on the basis of {GP} profiles.}

abstract = {The human gut microbiota is an important reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes ({ARGs}). A metagenomic approach and network analysis were used to establish a comprehensive antibiotic resistome catalog and to obtain co-occurrence patterns between {ARGs} and microbial taxa in fecal samples from 180 healthy individuals from 11 different countries. In total, 507 {ARG} subtypes belonging to 20 {ARG} types were detected with abundances ranging from 7.12 × 10-7 to 2.72 × 10-1 copy of {ARG}/copy of {16S}-{rRNA} gene. Tetracycline, multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, bacitracin, vancomycin, beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the top seven most abundant {ARG} types. The multidrug {ABC} transporter, {aadE}, {bacA}, {acrB}, {tetM}, {tetW}, {vanR} and {vanS} were shared by all 180 individuals, suggesting their common occurrence in the human gut. Compared to populations from the other 10 countries, the Chinese population harboured the most abundant {ARGs}. Moreover, {LEfSe} analysis suggested that the {MLS} resistance type and its subtype '{ermF}' were representative {ARGs} of the Chinese population. Antibiotic inactivation, antibiotic target alteration and antibiotic efflux were the dominant resistance mechanism categories in all populations. Procrustes analysis revealed that microbial phylogeny structured the antibiotic resistome. Co-occurrence patterns obtained via network analysis implied that 12 species might be potential hosts of 58 {ARG} subtypes. \copyright 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

An implementation of the {RP} and the closely related Rank Sum ({RS}) statistics has been available in the {RankProd} Bioconductor package for several years. However, several recent advances in the understanding of the statistical foundations of the method have made a complete refactoring of the existing package desirable. Results: We implemented a completely refactored version of the {RankProd} package, which provides a more principled implementation of the statistics for unpaired datasets. Moreover, the permutation-based P -value estimation methods have been replaced by exact methods, providing faster and more accurate results.

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Labelling experiments in biology usually make use of isotopically enriched substrates, with the two most commonly employed isotopes for metabolism being {2H} and {13C}. At the end of the experiment some metabolites will have incorporated the labelling isotope, to a degree that depends on the metabolic turnover. In order to propose a meaningful biological interpretation, it is necessary to estimate the amount of labelling, and one possible route is to exploit the fact that {MS} isotopic patterns reflect the isotopic distributions. {RESULTS}: We developed the {IsotopicLabelling} R package, a tool able to extract and analyze isotopic patterns from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) and gas chromatography-{MS} ({GC}-{MS}) data relative to labelling experiments. This package estimates the isotopic abundance of the employed stable isotope (either {2H} or {13C}) within a specified list of analytes. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The {IsotopicLabelling} R package is freely available at https://github.com/{RuggeroFerrazza}/{IsotopicLabelling} {CONTACTS}: r.ferrazza@unitn.{itSupplementary} information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author 2016.

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database or {HMDB} (www.hmdb.ca) is a web-enabled metabolomic database containing comprehensive information about human metabolites along with their biological roles, physiological concentrations, disease associations, chemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and reference spectra. First described in 2007, the {HMDB} is now considered the standard metabolomic resource for human metabolic studies. Over the past decade the {HMDB} has continued to grow and evolve in response to emerging needs for metabolomics researchers and continuing changes in web standards. This year's update, {HMDB} 4.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in its history. For instance, the number of fully annotated metabolites has increased by nearly threefold, the number of experimental spectra has grown by almost fourfold and the number of illustrated metabolic pathways has grown by a factor of almost 60. Significant improvements have also been made to the {HMDB}'s chemical taxonomy, chemical ontology, spectral viewing, and spectral/text searching tools. A great deal of brand new data has also been added to {HMDB} 4.0. This includes large quantities of predicted {MS}/{MS} and {GC}-{MS} reference spectral data as well as predicted (physiologically feasible) metabolite structures to facilitate novel metabolite identification. Additional information on metabolite-{SNP} interactions and the influence of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics) has also been added. Many other important improvements in the content, the interface, and the performance of the {HMDB} website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use and its potential applications in nutrition, biochemistry, clinical chemistry, clinical genetics, medicine, and metabolomics science. \copyright The Author(s) 2017.

abstract = {The diversity of experimental workflows involving {LC}-{MS}/{MS} and the extended range of mass spectrometers tend to produce extremely variable spectra. Variability reduces the accuracy of compound identification produced by commonly available software for a spectral library search. We introduce here a new algorithm that successfully matches {MS}/{MS} spectra generated by a range of instruments, acquired under different conditions. Our algorithm called X-Rank first sorts peak intensities of a spectrum and second establishes a correlation between two sorted spectra. X-Rank then computes the probability that a rank from an experimental spectrum matches a rank from a reference library spectrum. In a training step, characteristic parameter values are generated for a given data set. We compared the efficiency of the X-Rank algorithm with the dot-product algorithm implemented by {MS} Search from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}) on two test sets produced with different instruments. Overall the X-Rank algorithm accurately discriminates correct from wrong matches and detects more correct substances than the {MS} Search. Furthermore, X-Rank could correctly identify and top rank eight chemical compounds in a commercially available test mix. This confirms the ability of the algorithm to perform both a straight single-platform identification and a cross-platform library search in comparison to other tools. It also opens the possibility for efficient general unknown screening ({GUS}) against large compound libraries.}

Three organophosphate pesticides, chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos, and dicrotophos, were used as the model {CTAs}, with data collected for 4-6 sources per {CTA} and 7-10 replicate analyses per source. The analytical data were also evaluated to determine tentatively identified chemical attribution signatures for the {CTAs} by comparing samples from different sources according to either the presence/absence of peaks or the relative responses of peaks. These results demonstrate that {GC} × {GC}-{TOFMS} analysis in combination with a random forest technique can be useful in sample classification and signature identification for pesticides. Furthermore, the results suggest that this combination of analytical chemistry and statistical approaches can be applied to forensic analysis of other chemicals for similar purposes.}

abstract = {Many analytical approaches such as mass spectrometry generate large amounts of data (input variables) per sample analysed, and not all of these variables are important or related to the target output of interest. The selection of a smaller number of variables prior to sample classification is a widespread task in many research studies, where attempts are made to seek the lowest possible set of variables that are still able to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy; in other words, there is a need to generate the most parsimonious solution when the number of input variables is huge but the number of samples/objects are smaller. Here, we compare several different variable selection approaches in order to ascertain which of these are ideally suited to achieve this goal. All variable selection approaches were applied to the analysis of a common set of metabolomics data generated by Curie-point pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Py-{MS}), where the goal of the study was to classify the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus. These approaches include stepwise forward variable selection, used for linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}); variable importance for projection ({VIP}) coefficient, employed in partial least squares-discriminant analysis ({PLS}-{DA}); support vector machines-recursive feature elimination ({SVM}-{RFE}); as well as the mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in Gini, provided by random forests ({RF}). Finally, a double cross-validation procedure was applied to minimize the consequence of overfitting. The results revealed that {RF} with its variable selection techniques and {SVM} combined with {SVM}-{RFE} as a variable selection method, displayed the best results in comparison to other approaches.

Existing data preprocessing efforts have largely focused on methods which start by extracting features separately from each sample, followed by a subsequent attempt to group features across samples to facilitate comparisons. We show that this preprocessing approach leads to unnecessary variability in peak quantifications that adversely impacts downstream analysis. We present a new method, bakedpi, for the preprocessing of both centroid and profile mode metabolomics data that relies on an intensity-weighted bivariate kernel density estimation on a pooling of all samples to detect peaks.

By using an integrated phytochemical and metabolomics approach coupled with multivariate statistical analysis, we propose a new strategy, Poly-{PK}, to simultaneously monitor the performance of drug constituents and endogenous metabolites, taking into account both the diversity of the drug's chemical composition and its complex effects on the mammalian metabolic pathways. Poly-{PK} is independent of specific measurement platforms and has been successfully applied in the {PK} studies of Puerh tea, a traditional Chinese medicine Huangqi decoction and many other multi-component drugs. Here, we introduce an R package, {polyPK}, the first and only automation of the data analysis pipeline of Poly-{PK} strategy. {polyPK} provides 10 functions for data pre-processing, differential compound identification and grouping, traditional {PK} parameters calculation, multivariate statistical analysis, correlations, cluster analyses and resulting visualization. It may serve a wide range of users, including pharmacologists, biologists and doctors, in understanding the metabolic fate of multi-component drugs.

To handle large data sets and to efficiently utilize all the features available in the vendor software (baseline correction, mass spectral deconvolution, peak picking, integration, library search, and signal-to-noise filtering), data preprocessed by instrument software are used as a starting point for further processing. Our software affords alignment of the data, normalization, data filtering, and utilization of retention indexes in the verification of identification as well as a novel tool for automated group-type identification of the compounds. Herein, different features of the software are studied in detail and the performance of the system is verified by the analysis of a large set of standard samples as well as of a large set of authentic biological samples, including the control samples. The quantitative features of our {GC}×{GC}/{TOFMS} methodology are also studied to further demonstrate the method performance and the experimental results confirm the reliability of the developed procedure.

abstract = {The relatively new research discipline of Eco-Metabolomics is the application of metabolomics techniques to ecology with the aim to characterise biochemical interactions of organisms across different spatial and temporal scales. Metabolomics is an untargeted biochemical approach to measure many thousands of metabolites in different species, including plants and animals. Changes in metabolite concentrations can provide mechanistic evidence for biochemical processes that are relevant at ecological scales. These include physiological, phenotypic and morphological responses of plants and communities to environmental changes and also interactions with other organisms. Traditionally, research in biochemistry and ecology comes from two different directions and is performed at distinct spatiotemporal scales. Biochemical studies most often focus on intrinsic processes in individuals at physiological and cellular scales. Generally, they take a bottom-up approach scaling up cellular processes from spatiotemporally fine to coarser scales. Ecological studies usually focus on extrinsic processes acting upon organisms at population and community scales and typically study top-down and bottom-up processes in combination. Eco-Metabolomics is a transdisciplinary research discipline that links biochemistry and ecology and connects the distinct spatiotemporal scales. In this review, we focus on approaches to study chemical and biochemical interactions of plants at various ecological levels, mainly plant⁻organismal interactions, and discuss related examples from other domains. We present recent developments and highlight advancements in Eco-Metabolomics over the last decade from various angles. We further address the five key challenges: (1) complex experimental designs and large variation of metabolite profiles; (2) feature extraction; (3) metabolite identification; (4) statistical analyses; and (5) bioinformatics software tools and workflows. The presented solutions to these challenges will advance connecting the distinct spatiotemporal scales and bridging biochemistry and ecology.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Batch effects in large untargeted metabolomics experiments are almost unavoidable, especially when sensitive detection techniques like mass spectrometry ({MS}) are employed. In order to obtain peak intensities that are comparable across all batches, corrections need to be performed. Since non-detects, i.e., signals with an intensity too low to be detected with certainty, are common in metabolomics studies, the batch correction methods need to take these into account. {OBJECTIVES}: This paper aims to compare several batch correction methods, and investigates the effect of different strategies for handling non-detects. {METHODS}: Batch correction methods usually consist of regression models, possibly also accounting for trends within batches. To fit these models quality control samples ({QCs}), injected at regular intervals, can be used. Also study samples can be used, provided that the injection order is properly randomized. Normalization methods, not using information on batch labels or injection order, can correct for batch effects as well. Introducing two easy-to-use quality criteria, we assess the merits of these batch correction strategies using three large {LC}-{MS} and {GC}-{MS} data sets of samples {fromArabidopsis} thaliana. {RESULTS}: The three data sets have very different characteristics, leading to clearly distinct behaviour of the batch correction strategies studied. Explicit inclusion of information on batch and injection order in general leads to very good corrections; when enough {QCs} are available, also general normalization approaches perform well. Several approaches are shown to be able to handle non-detects-replacing them with very small numbers such as zero seems the worst of the approaches considered. {CONCLUSION}: The use of quality control samples for batch correction leads to good results when enough {QCs} are available. If an experiment is properly set up, batch correction using the study samples usually leads to a similar high-quality correction, but has the advantage that more metabolites are corrected. The strategy for handling non-detects is important: choosing small values like zero can lead to suboptimal batch corrections.}

abstract = {One-dimensional ({1D}) (1)H {NMR} spectroscopy remains a leading analytical technology in metabolomics. Advantages of this approach include relatively rapid spectral acquisition and {NMR} resonances that provide a direct measure of metabolite concentration based upon a single internal standard. Severe spectral congestion can, however, significantly hinder both metabolite identification and quantification. Two-dimensional (1)H J-resolved ({JRES}) {NMR} spectroscopy retains many of the benefits of {1D} {NMR}, but additionally disperses the overlapping resonances into a second dimension, reducing congestion and increasing metabolite specificity. The usefulness of this approach to metabolomics was first realised six years ago, and since then it has been used in biological, medical and environmental studies of plants and animals. Here we provide a basic introduction to the {2D} {JRES} {NMR} experiment and then discuss strategies for spectral acquisition and processing in the context of metabolomics applications, concluding with some key recommendations: acquisition using a double spin-echo sequence with excitation sculpting; processing using the {SEM} window function, tilting and symmetricising, optionally followed by a skyline projection. Strategies for implementing {JRES} spectroscopy into the metabolomics toolbox are then considered, including its roles in metabolic fingerprinting, metabolite identification and metabolite quantification. Public resources and data standards for {JRES} metabolomics are reviewed. We conclude by evaluating the advantages (e.g. increased spectral dispersion and confidence in metabolite identification; fully automated processing; reduced batch-to-batch variation) and disadvantages (e.g. longer acquisition times; higher technical variability; phase-twisted lineshapes resulting in quantification errors) of {2D} {JRES} {NMR} vs the established {1D} approach for metabolomics.

The method involves the acquisition of three two dimensional ({2D}) {NMR} spectra simultaneously using a dual receiver system. The three spectra, namely: (1) G-matrix Fourier transform ({GFT}) (3,2)D [(13)C, (1)H] {HSQC}-{TOCSY}, (2) {2D} (1)H-(1)H {TOCSY} and (3) {2D} (13)C-(1)H {HETCOR} are acquired in a single experiment and provide mutually complementary information to completely assign individual metabolites in a mixture. The {GFT} (3,2)D [(13)C, (1)H] {HSQC}-{TOCSY} provides {3D} correlations in a reduced dimensionality manner facilitating high resolution and unambiguous assignments. The experiments were applied for complete (1)H and (13)C assignments of a mixture of 21 unlabeled metabolites corresponding to a medium used in assisted reproductive technology. Taken together, the experiments provide time gain of order of magnitudes compared to the conventional data acquisition methods and can be combined with other fast {NMR} techniques such as non-uniform sampling and covariance spectroscopy.

To date, established software packages used to match and quantify metabolites in {NMR} spectra remain mostly manually operated, leading to low resolution results and subject to inconsistencies not attributable to the {NMR} technique itself.

Dolphin takes advantage of the {2D} J-resolved {NMR} spectroscopy signal dispersion to avoid inconsistencies in signal position detection, enhancing the reliability and confidence in metabolite matching. Furthermore, in order to improve accuracy in quantification, Dolphin uses {2D} {NMR} spectra to obtain additional information on all neighboring signals surrounding the target metabolite. We have compared the targeted profiling results of Dolphin, recorded from standard biological mixtures, with those of two well established approaches in {NMR} metabolomics. Overall, Dolphin produced more accurate results with the added advantage of being a fully automated and high throughput processing package.}

abstract = {Metabolic profiling is routinely performed on multiple analytical platforms to increase the coverage of detected metabolites, and it is often necessary to distribute biological and clinical samples from a study between instruments of the same type to share the workload between different laboratories. The ability to combine metabolomics data arising from different sources is therefore of great interest, particularly for large-scale or long-term studies, where samples must be analyzed in separate blocks. This is not a trivial task, however, due to differing data structures, temporal variability, and instrumental drift. In this study, we employed blood serum and plasma samples collected from 29 subjects diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and analyzed each sample on two liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) platforms. We describe a method for mapping retention times and matching metabolite features between platforms and approaches for fusing data acquired from both instruments. Calibration transfer models were developed and shown to be successful at mapping the response of one {LC}-{MS} instrument to another (Procrustes dissimilarity = 0.04; Mantel correlation = 0.95), allowing us to merge the data from different samples analyzed on different instruments. Data fusion was assessed in a clinical context by comparing the correlation of each metabolite with subject survival time in both the original and fused data sets: a simple autoscaling procedure (Pearson's R = 0.99) was found to improve upon a calibration transfer method based on partial least-squares regression (R = 0.94).}

abstract = {Multi-omics studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis ({MOFA}), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. {MOFA} infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied {MOFA} to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, {RNA} expression, {DNA} methylation and ex vivo drug responses. {MOFA} identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used {MOFA} to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation. \copyright 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Lipids are ubiquitous and serve numerous biological functions; thus lipids have been shown to have great potential as candidates for elucidating biomarkers and pathway perturbations associated with disease. Methods expanding coverage of the lipidome increase the likelihood of biomarker discovery and could lead to more comprehensive understanding of disease etiology. {RESULTS}: We introduce {LipidMatch}, an R-based tool for lipid identification for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry workflows. {LipidMatch} currently has over 250,000 lipid species spanning 56 lipid types contained in in silico fragmentation libraries. Unique fragmentation libraries, compared to other open source software, include oxidized lipids, bile acids, sphingosines, and previously uncharacterized adducts, including ammoniated cardiolipins. {LipidMatch} uses rule-based identification. For each lipid type, the user can select which fragments must be observed for identification. Rule-based identification allows for correct annotation of lipids based on the fragments observed, unlike typical identification based solely on spectral similarity scores, where over-reporting structural details that are not conferred by fragmentation data is common. Another unique feature of {LipidMatch} is ranking lipid identifications for a given feature by the sum of fragment intensities. For each lipid candidate, the intensities of experimental fragments with exact mass matches to expected in silico fragments are summed. The lipid identifications with the greatest summed intensity using this ranking algorithm were comparable to other lipid identification software annotations, {MS}-{DIAL} and Greazy. For example, for features with identifications from all 3 software, 92\% of {LipidMatch} identifications by fatty acyl constituents were corroborated by at least one other software in positive mode and 98\% in negative ion mode. {CONCLUSIONS}: {LipidMatch} allows users to annotate lipids across a wide range of high resolution tandem mass spectrometry experiments, including imaging experiments, direct infusion experiments, and experiments employing liquid chromatography. {LipidMatch} leverages the most extensive in silico fragmentation libraries of freely available software. When integrated into a larger lipidomics workflow, {LipidMatch} may increase the probability of finding lipid-based biomarkers and determining etiology of disease by covering a greater portion of the lipidome and using annotation which does not over-report biologically relevant structural details of identified lipid molecules.}

abstract = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests are promising approaches for prediction based on high dimensional omics data sets. They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination ({RFE}).  In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings. \copyright The Author 2017.

Few bioinformatic tools have been developed for the visualization, exploration and analysis of metabolomic data within the context of metabolic pathways: some of them became rapidly obsolete and are no longer supported, others are based on a single database. A systematic collection of existing annotations has the potential of considerably boosting the investigation and contextualization of metabolomic measurements. Results: We have released a major update of our Bioconductor package graphite which explicitly tracks small molecules within pathway topologies and their interactions with proteins. The package gathers the information stored in eight major databases, oriented both at genes and at metabolites, across 14 different species. Depending on user preferences, all pathways can be retrieved as gene-only, gene-metabolite or metabolite-only networks. Availability: The new graphite version (1.24) is available on Bioconductor.

abstract = {The complexity of metabolome presents a great analytical challenge for quantitative metabolite profiling, and restricts the application of metabolomics in biomarker discovery. Targeted metabolomics using multiple-reaction monitoring ({MRM}) technique has excellent capability for quantitative analysis, but suffers from the limited metabolite coverage. To address this challenge, we developed a new strategy, namely, {SWATHtoMRM}, which utilizes the broad coverage of {SWATH}-{MS} technology to develop high-coverage targeted metabolomics method. Specifically, {SWATH}-{MS} technique was first utilized to untargeted profile one pooled biological sample and to acquire the {MS2} spectra for all metabolites. Then, {SWATHtoMRM} was used to extract the large-scale {MRM} transitions for targeted analysis with coverage as high as 1000-2000 metabolites. Then, we demonstrated the advantages of {SWATHtoMRM} method in quantitative analysis such as coverage, reproducibility, sensitivity, and dynamic range. Finally, we applied our {SWATHtoMRM} approach to discover potential metabolite biomarkers for colorectal cancer ({CRC}) diagnosis. A high-coverage targeted metabolomics method with 1303 metabolites in one injection was developed to profile colorectal cancer tissues from {CRC} patients. A total of 20 potential metabolite biomarkers were discovered and validated for {CRC} diagnosis. In plasma samples from {CRC} patients, 17 out of 20 potential biomarkers were further validated to be associated with tumor resection, which may have a great potential in assessing the prognosis of {CRC} patients after tumor resection. Together, the {SWATHtoMRM} strategy provides a new way to develop high-coverage targeted metabolomics method, and facilitates the application of targeted metabolomics in disease biomarker discovery. The {SWATHtoMRM} program is freely available on the Internet ( http://www.zhulab.cn/software.php ).}

As the complexity of the acquired {NMR} data increases, the task of analysing these data constantly becomes more and more demanding and new methods are required to facilitate the analysis. With one-dimensional {NMR} data multivariate data analysis has proven to be a strong tool, but how should one analyse higher-dimensional {NMR} data in order to extract as much relevant information as possible without having to break data down into smaller dimensions and thus lose the inherent structure? A class of multivariate data analytical techniques called multi-way analysis encompass techniques that have been designed to handle and analyse such data structures directly. In this paper, the theory of some of the most commonly used multi-way methods will be described and examples of their application to three-way arrays of {NMR} data reported in the literature will be given. The focus will be on the generic principles of multi-way analysis using three-way data in order to gently introduce the new concepts.}

However, this is not the case with {O2PLS}. {RESULTS}: We introduce {OmicsPLS}, an open-source implementation of the {O2PLS} method in R. It can handle both low- and high-dimensional datasets efficiently. Generic methods for inspecting and visualizing results are implemented.

abstract = {Compound identification is the main hurdle in {LC}-{HRMS}-based metabolomics, given the high number of 'unknown' metabolites. In recent years, numerous in silico fragmentation simulators have been developed to simplify and improve mass spectral interpretation and compound annotation. Nevertheless, expert mass spectrometry users and chemists are still needed to select the correct entry from the numerous candidates proposed by automatic tools, especially in the plant kingdom due to the huge structural diversity of natural compounds occurring in plants. In this work, we propose the use of a supervised machine learning approach to predict molecular substructures from isotopic patterns, training the model on a large database of grape metabolites. This approach, called 'Compounds Characteristics Comparison' ({CCC}) emulates the experience of a plant chemist who 'gains experience' from a (proof-of-principle) dataset of grape compounds. The results show that the {CCC} approach is able to predict with good accuracy most of the sub-structures proposed. In addition, after querying {MS}/{MS} spectra in Metfrag 2.2 and applying {CCC} predictions as scoring terms with real data, the {CCC} approach helped to give a better ranking to the correct candidates, improving users' confidence in candidate selection. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach can complement current identification strategies based on fragmentation simulators and formula calculators, assisting compound identification.

abstract = {{KEGG} (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; https://www.kegg.jp/ or https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a reference knowledge base for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. It is an integrated database consisting of three generic categories of systems information, genomic information and chemical information, and an additional human-specific category of health information. {KEGG} pathway maps, {BRITE} hierarchies and {KEGG} modules have been developed as generic molecular networks with {KEGG} Orthology nodes of functional orthologs so that {KEGG} pathway mapping and other procedures can be applied to any cellular organism. Unfortunately, however, this generic approach was inadequate for knowledge representation in the health information category, where variations of human genomes, especially disease-related variations, had to be considered. Thus, we have introduced a new approach where human gene variants are explicitly incorporated into what we call 'network variants' in the recently released {KEGG} {NETWORK} database. This allows accumulation of knowledge about disease-related perturbed molecular networks caused not only by gene variants, but also by viruses and other pathogens, environmental factors and drugs. We expect that {KEGG} {NETWORK} will become another reference knowledge base for the basic understanding of disease mechanisms and practical use in clinical sequencing and drug development.}

abstract = {High resolution {LC}-{MS}-untargeted lipidomics using data-independent acquisition ({DIA}) has the potential to increase lipidome coverage as it enables the continuous and unbiased acquisition of all eluting ions. However, the loss of the link between the precursor and the product ions combined with the high dimensionality of {DIA} data sets hinder accurate feature annotation. Here, we present {LipidMS}, an R-package aimed to confidently identify lipid species in untargeted {LC}-{DIA}-{MS}. To this end, {LipidMS} combines a coelution score, which links precursor and fragment ions, with fragmentation and intensity rules. Depending on the {MS} evidence reached by the identification function survey, {LipidMS} provides three levels of structural annotations: i) "subclass level", e.g., {PG}(34:1); ii) "fatty acyl level", e.g., {PG}(16:0\_18:1); and iii) "fatty acyl position level", e.g., {PG}(16:0/18:1). The comparison of {LipidMS} with freely available data-dependent acquisition ({DDA}) and {DIA} identification tools showed that {LipidMS} provides significantly more accurate and structural informative lipid identifications. Finally, to exemplify the utility of {LipidMS}, we investigated the lipidomic serum profile of patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ({NASH}), which is the progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a disorder underlying a strong lipid dysregulation. As previously published, a significant decrease in lyso- and phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol esters and an increase in phosphatidylethanolamines were observed in {NASH} patients. Remarkably, {LipidMS} allowed to identify a new set of lipids that may be used for {NASH} diagnosis. Altogether, {LipidMS} has been validated as a tool to assist lipid identification in the {LC}-{DIA}-{MS} untargeted analysis of complex biological samples.}

abstract = {Chemical cues are arguably the most fundamental means of animal communication and play an important role in mate choice and kin recognition. Consequently, there is growing interest in the use of gas chromatography ({GC}) to investigate the chemical basis of eco-evolutionary interactions. Both {GC}-{MS} (mass spectrometry) and {FID} (flame ionization detection) are commonly used to characterise the chemical composition of biological samples such as skin swabs. The resulting chromatograms comprise peaks that are separated according to their retention times and which represent different substances. Across chromatograms of different samples, homologous substances are expected to elute at similar retention times. However, random and often unavoidable experimental variation introduces noise, making the alignment of homologous peaks challenging, particularly with {GC}-{FID} data where mass spectral data are lacking. Here we present {GCalignR}, a user-friendly R package for aligning {GC}-{FID} data based on retention times. The package was developed specifically for ecological and evolutionary studies that seek to investigate similarity patterns across multiple and often highly variable biological samples, for example representing different sexes, age classes or reproductive stages. The package also implements dynamic visualisations to facilitate inspection and fine-tuning of the resulting alignments and can be integrated within a broader workflow in R to facilitate downstream multivariate analyses. We demonstrate an example workflow using empirical data from Antarctic fur seals and explore the impact of user-defined parameter values by calculating alignment error rates for multiple datasets. The resulting alignments had low error rates for most of the explored parameter space and we could also show that {GCalignR} performed equally well or better than other available software. We hope that {GCalignR} will help to simplify the processing of chemical datasets and improve the standardization and reproducibility of chemical analyses in studies of animal chemical communication and related fields.}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Validation of variable selection and predictive performance is crucial in construction of robust multivariate models that generalize well, minimize overfitting and facilitate interpretation of results. Inappropriate variable selection leads instead to selection bias, thereby increasing the risk of model overfitting and false positive discoveries. Although several algorithms exist to identify a minimal set of most informative variables (i.e. the minimal-optimal problem), few can select all variables related to the research question (i.e. the all-relevant problem). Robust algorithms combining identification of both minimal-optimal and all-relevant variables with proper cross-validation are urgently needed. {RESULTS}: We developed the {MUVR} algorithm to improve predictive performance and minimize overfitting and false positives in multivariate analysis. In the {MUVR} algorithm, minimal variable selection is achieved by performing recursive variable elimination in a repeated double cross-validation ({rdCV}) procedure. The algorithm supports partial least squares and random forest modelling, and simultaneously identifies minimal-optimal and all-relevant variable sets for regression, classification and multilevel analyses. Using three authentic omics datasets, {MUVR} yielded parsimonious models with minimal overfitting and improved model performance compared with state-of-the-art {rdCV}. Moreover, {MUVR} showed advantages over other variable selection algorithms, i.e. Boruta and {VSURF}, including simultaneous variable selection and validation scheme and wider applicability. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Algorithms, data, scripts and tutorial are open source and available as an R package ('{MUVR}') at https://gitlab.com/{CarlBrunius}/{MUVR}.git. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) 2018.

In addition to providing a list of pathways, {FELLA} reports intermediate entities (modules, enzymes, reactions) that link the input metabolites to them. This sheds light on pathway cross talk and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the condition under study. {FELLA} has been applied to six public datasets -three from Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus musculus- and has reproduced findings from the original studies and from independent literature. {CONCLUSIONS}: The R package {FELLA} offers an innovative enrichment concept starting from a list of metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the {KEGG} database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting a list of pathways, {FELLA} suggests intermediate entities that are of interest per se. Its usefulness has been shown at several molecular levels on six public datasets, including human and animal models.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data improves functional interpretation of disease-related metabolomic phenotypes, and facilitates discovery of putative metabolite biomarkers and gene targets. For this reason, these data are increasingly collected in large (\textgreater 100 participants) cohorts, thereby driving a need for the development of user-friendly and open-source methods/tools for their integration. Of note, clinical/translational studies typically provide snapshot (e.g. one time point) gene and metabolite profiles and, oftentimes, most metabolites measured are not identified. Thus, in these types of studies, pathway/network approaches that take into account the complexity of transcript-metabolite relationships may neither be applicable nor readily uncover novel relationships. With this in mind, we propose a simple linear modeling approach to capture disease-(or other phenotype) specific gene-metabolite associations, with the assumption that co-regulation patterns reflect functionally related genes and metabolites. {RESULTS}: The proposed linear model, metabolite \~ gene + phenotype + gene:phenotype, specifically evaluates whether gene-metabolite relationships differ by phenotype, by testing whether the relationship in one phenotype is significantly different from the relationship in another phenotype (via a statistical interaction gene:phenotype p-value). Statistical interaction p-values for all possible gene-metabolite pairs are computed and significant pairs are then clustered by the directionality of associations (e.g. strong positive association in one phenotype, strong negative association in another phenotype). We implemented our approach as an R package, {IntLIM}, which includes a user-friendly R Shiny web interface, thereby making the integrative analyses accessible to non-computational experts. We applied {IntLIM} to two previously published datasets, collected in the {NCI}-60 cancer cell lines and in human breast tumor and non-tumor tissue, for which transcriptomic and metabolomic data are available. We demonstrate that {IntLIM} captures relevant tumor-specific gene-metabolite associations involved in known cancer-related pathways, including glutamine metabolism. Using {IntLIM}, we also uncover biologically relevant novel relationships that could be further tested experimentally. {CONCLUSIONS}: {IntLIM} provides a user-friendly, reproducible framework to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data and help interpret metabolomic data and uncover novel gene-metabolite relationships. The {IntLIM} R package is publicly available in {GitHub} ( https://github.com/mathelab/{IntLIM} ) and includes a user-friendly web application, vignettes, sample data and data/code to reproduce results.}

In a proof-of-concept study, we identified 59 and 6 novel metabolites in lemna and tomato fruit, respectively. Significantly, 20-30\% of the identified metabolites were found to contain at least one structural isomer that displays a different distribution pattern. The notable feature of this approach is the ability to differentiate localization of structural isomers, hence, providing the "true" distribution of molecules of interest.}

Working within the consortia of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, Proteomics Standards Initiative, and the Metabolomics Society, we have created {mzTab}-M to act as a common output format from analytical approaches using {MS} on small molecules. The format has been developed over several years, with input from a wide range of stakeholders. {mzTab}-M is a simple tab-separated text format, but importantly, the structure is highly standardized through the design of a detailed specification document, tightly coupled to validation software, and a mandatory controlled vocabulary of terms to populate it. The format is able to represent final quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from {MS} (e.g., {LC}-{MS}, {GC}-{MS}, {DIMS}, etc.) and different types of approaches used to identify molecules. {mzTab}-M allows for ambiguity in the identification of molecules to be communicated clearly to readers of the files (both people and software).

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: In metabolomics, the detection of new biomarkers from {NMR} spectra is a promising approach. However, this analysis remains difficult due to the lack of a whole workflow that handles spectra pre-processing, automatic identification and quantification of metabolites and statistical analyses, in a reproducible way. {RESULTS}: We present {ASICS}, an R package that contains a complete workflow to analyse spectra from {NMR} experiments. It contains an automatic approach to identify and quantify metabolites in a complex mixture spectrum and uses the results of the quantification in untargeted and targeted statistical analyses. {ASICS} was shown to improve the precision of quantification in comparison to existing methods on two independent datasets. In addition, {ASICS} successfully recovered most metabolites that were found important to explain a two level condition describing the samples by a manual and expert analysis based on bucketting. It also found new relevant metabolites involved in metabolic pathways related to risk factors associated with the condition. {AVAILABILITY}: {ASICS} is distributed as an R package, available on Bioconductor. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) (2019).

abstract = {The uncertainties in analysis of trace environmental pollutants may come from sample matrix and sample pretreatment process. In this study, a boundary model was developed based on the visualized data of mass spectrometry to evaluate the influences from sample matrix and pretreatment process. The factors affecting the pretreatment procedures, such as the solvents, the extraction sorbents and the extraction process had limited influences compared with matrix effects. Using such boundary model, we found that selecting suitable qualitative and quantitative ions for {MS} detector is more important for reducing the matrix effect in {GC}-{MS} analysis than the traditionally used methods of optimizing the pretreatment process since some clean up sorbents might be useless to reduce the matrix effects. As for 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether ({BDE}-99), the fragmental ions were usually used for qualitative and quantitative analysis, which however was easily affected by the matrix effects. While, molecular ions would eliminate the influences from the sample matrix. Such a model could be used to decrease the uncertainty and increase the accuracy of environmental trace analysis.

This kind of analysis is especially cumbersome for complex samples with hundreds to thousands of unknown features. Traditionally, the annotation was done manually imposing constraints in reproducibility and automatization. Furthermore, different analysis tools are typically used at different steps which requires parsing of data and changing of environments. We present here {MetNet}, implemented in the R programming language and available as an open-source package via the Bioconductor project. {MetNet}, which is compatible with the output of the xcms/{CAMERA} suite, uses the data-rich output of mass spectrometry metabolomics to putatively link features on their relation to other features in the data set. {MetNet} uses both structural and quantitative information on metabolomics data for network inference and enables the annotation of unknown analytes.}

abstract = {Metabolomics experiments identify metabolites whose abundance varies as the conditions under study change. Pathway enrichment tools help in the identification of key metabolic processes and in building a plausible biological explanation for these variations. Although several methods are available for pathway enrichment using experimental evidence, metabolomics does not yet have a comprehensive overview in a network layout at multiple molecular levels. We propose a novel pathway enrichment procedure for analysing summary metabolomics data based on sub-network analysis in a graph representation of a reference database. Relevant entries are extracted from the database according to statistical measures over a null diffusive process that accounts for network topology and pathway crosstalk. Entries are reported as a sub-pathway network, including not only pathways, but also modules, enzymes, reactions and possibly other compound candidates for further analyses. This provides a richer biological context, suitable for generating new study hypotheses and potential enzymatic targets. Using this method, we report results from cells depleted for an uncharacterised mitochondrial gene using {GC} and {LC}-{MS} data and employing {KEGG} as a knowledge base. Partial validation is provided with {NMR}-based tracking of {13C} glucose labelling of these cells.}

abstract = {Differential expression ({DE}) analysis is commonly used to identify biomarker candidates that have significant changes in their expression levels between distinct biological groups. One drawback of {DE} analysis is that it only considers the changes on single biomolecule level. Recently, differential network ({DN}) analysis has become popular due to its capability to measure the changes on biomolecular pair level. In {DN} analysis, network is typically built based on correlation and biomarker candidates are selected by investigating the network topology. However, correlation tends to generate over-complicated networks and the selection of biomarker candidates purely based on network topology ignores the changes on single biomolecule level. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, {INDEED}, that builds sparse differential network based on partial correlation and integrates {DE} and {DN} analyses for biomarker discovery. We applied this approach on real proteomic and glycomic data generated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry for hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) biomarker discovery study. For each omic data, we used one dataset to select biomarker candidates, built a disease classifier and evaluated the performance of the classifier on an independent dataset. The biomarker candidates, selected by {INDEED}, were more reproducible across independent datasets, and led to a higher classification accuracy in predicting {HCC} cases and cirrhotic controls compared with those selected by separate {DE} and {DN} analyses. {INDEED} also identified some candidates previously reported to be relevant to {HCC}, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 2 ({ICAM2}) and c4b-binding protein alpha chain ({C4BPA}), which were missed by both {DE} and {DN} analyses. In addition, we applied {INDEED} for survival time prediction based on transcriptomic data acquired by analysis of samples from breast cancer patients. We selected biomarker candidates and built a regression model for survival time prediction based on a gene expression dataset and patients' survival records. We evaluated the performance of the regression model on an independent dataset. Compared with the biomarker candidates selected by {DE} and {DN} analyses, those selected through {INDEED} led to more accurate survival time prediction. Copyright Â\copyright 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Annotating these features is of the utmost importance for answering questions as fundamental as, for example, how many metabolites are there in a given sample. {RESULTS}: Here, we introduce {CliqueMS}, a new algorithm for annotating in-source {LC}-{MS1} data. {CliqueMS} is based on the similarity between coelution profiles and therefore, as opposed to most methods, allows for the annotation of a single spectrum. Furthermore, {CliqueMS} improves upon the state of the art in several dimensions: (i) it uses a more discriminatory feature similarity metric; (ii) it treats the similarities between features in a transparent way by means of a simple generative model; (iii) it uses a well-grounded maximum likelihood inference approach to group features; (iv) it uses empirical adduct frequencies to identify the parental mass; and (v) it deals more flexibly with the identification of the parental mass by proposing and ranking alternative annotations. We validate our approach with simple mixtures of standards and with real complex biological samples. {CliqueMS} reduces the thousands of features typically obtained in complex samples to hundreds of metabolites, and it is able to correctly annotate more metabolites and adducts from a single spectrum than available tools. {AVAILABILITY}: https://{CRAN}.R-project.org/package={cliqueMS} and https://github.com/osenan/{cliqueMS}. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data, figures and text are available at Bioinformatics online. \copyright The Author(s) 2019.

abstract = {The identification of metabolites by mass spectrometry constitutes a major bottleneck which considerably limits the throughput of metabolomics studies in biomedical or plant research. Here, we present a novel approach to analyze metabolomics data from untargeted, data-independent {LC}-{MS}/{MS} measurements. By integrated analysis of {MS}(1) abundances and {MS}/{MS} spectra, the identification of regulated metabolite families is achieved. This approach offers a global view on metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We implemented our approach in the web application "{MetFamily}", which is freely available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/{MetFamily}/ . {MetFamily} provides a dynamic link between the patterns based on {MS}(1)-signal intensity and the corresponding structural similarity at the {MS}/{MS} level. Structurally related metabolites are annotated as metabolite families based on a hierarchical cluster analysis of measured {MS}/{MS} spectra. Joint examination with principal component analysis of {MS}(1) patterns, where this annotation is preserved in the loadings, facilitates the interpretation of comparative metabolomics data at the level of metabolite families. As a proof of concept, we identified two trichome-specific metabolite families from wild-type tomato Solanum habrochaites {LA1777} in a fully unsupervised manner and validated our findings based on earlier publications and with {NMR}.}

abstract = {Metabolic analyses generally fall into two classes: unbiased metabolomic analyses and analyses that are targeted toward specific metabolites. Both techniques have been revolutionized by the advent of mass spectrometers with detectors that afford high mass accuracy and resolution, such as time-of-flights ({TOFs}) and Orbitraps. One particular area where this technology is key is in the field of metabolic flux analysis because the resolution of these spectrometers allows for discrimination between {13C}-containing isotopologues and those containing {15N} or other isotopes. While {XCMS}-based software is freely available for untargeted analysis of mass spectrometric data sets, it does not always identify metabolites of interest in a targeted assay. Furthermore, there is a paucity of vendor-independent software that deals with targeted analyses of metabolites and of isotopologues in particular. Here, we present {AssayR}, an R package that takes high resolution wide-scan liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) data sets and tailors peak detection for each metabolite through a simple, iterative user interface. It automatically integrates peak areas for all isotopologues and outputs extracted ion chromatograms ({EICs}), absolute and relative stacked bar charts for all isotopologues, and a .csv data file. We demonstrate several examples where {AssayR} provides more accurate and robust quantitation than {XCMS}, and we propose that tailored peak detection should be the preferred approach for targeted assays. In summary, {AssayR} provides easy and robust targeted metabolite and stable isotope analyses on wide-scan data sets from high resolution mass spectrometers.}

abstract = {{rOpenSci} is a developer collective originally formed in 2011 by graduate students and post-docs from ecology and evolutionary biology to collaborate on building software tools to facilitate a more open and synthetic approach in the face of transformative rise of large and heterogeneous data. Born on the internet (the collective only began through chance discussions over social media), we have grown into a widely recognized effort that supports an ecosystem of some 45 software packages, engages scores of collaborators, has taught dozens of workshops around the world, and has secured over \$480,000 in grant support. As young scientists working in an academic context largely without direct support for our efforts, we have first hand experience with most of the the technical and social challenges {W\SSSPE} seeks to address. In this paper we provide an experience report which describes our approach and success in building an effective and diverse community.}

abstract = {Over the past two decades, nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) has emerged as one of the three principal analytical techniques used in metabolomics (the other two being gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) and liquid chromatography coupled with single-stage mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS})). The relative ease of sample preparation, the ability to quantify metabolite levels, the high level of experimental reproducibility, and the inherently nondestructive nature of {NMR} spectroscopy have made it the preferred platform for long-term or large-scale clinical metabolomic studies. These advantages, however, are often outweighed by the fact that most other analytical techniques, including both {LC}-{MS} and {GC}-{MS}, are inherently more sensitive than {NMR}, with lower limits of detection typically being 10 to 100 times better. This review is intended to introduce readers to the field of {NMR}-based metabolomics and to highlight both the advantages and disadvantages of {NMR} spectroscopy for metabolomic studies. It will also explore some of the unique strengths of {NMR}-based metabolomics, particularly with regard to isotope selection/detection, mixture deconvolution via {2D} spectroscopy, automation, and the ability to noninvasively analyze native tissue specimens. Finally, this review will highlight a number of emerging {NMR} techniques and technologies that are being used to strengthen its utility and overcome its inherent limitations in metabolomic applications.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microbial genomes at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ({NCBI}) represent a large collection of more than 35,000 assemblies. There are several complexities associated with the data: a great variation in sampling density since human pathogens are densely sampled while other bacteria are less represented; different protein families occur in annotations with different frequencies; and the quality of genome annotation varies greatly. In order to extract useful information from these sophisticated data, the analysis needs to be performed at multiple levels of phylogenomic resolution and protein similarity, with an adequate sampling strategy. {RESULTS}: Protein clustering is used to construct meaningful and stable groups of similar proteins to be used for analysis and functional annotation. Our approach is to create protein clusters at three levels. First, tight clusters in groups of closely-related genomes (species-level clades) are constructed using a combined approach that takes into account both sequence similarity and genome context. Second, clustroids of conservative in-clade clusters are organized into seed global clusters. Finally, global protein clusters are built around the the seed clusters. We propose filtering strategies that allow limiting the protein set included in global clustering. The in-clade clustering procedure, subsequent selection of clustroids and organization into seed global clusters provides a robust representation and high rate of compression. Seed protein clusters are further extended by adding related proteins. Extended seed clusters include a significant part of the data and represent all major known cell machinery. The remaining part, coming from either non-conservative (unique) or rapidly evolving proteins, from rare genomes, or resulting from low-quality annotation, does not group together well. Processing these proteins requires significant computational resources and results in a large number of questionable clusters. {CONCLUSION}: The developed filtering strategies allow to identify and exclude such peripheral proteins limiting the protein dataset in global clustering. Overall, the proposed methodology allows the relevant data at different levels of details to be obtained and data redundancy eliminated while keeping biologically interesting variations.}

abstract = {The problem of partitioning a collection of objects based on their measurements on a set of dichotomous variables is a well-established problem in psychological research, with applications including clinical diagnosis, educational testing, cognitive categorization, and choice analysis. Latent class analysis and K-means clustering are popular methods for partitioning objects based on dichotomous measures in the psychological literature. The K-median clustering method has recently been touted as a potentially useful tool for psychological data and might be preferable to its close neighbor, K-means, when the variable measures are dichotomous. We conducted simulation-based comparisons of the latent class, K-means, and K-median approaches for partitioning dichotomous data. Although all 3 methods proved capable of recovering cluster structure, K-median clustering yielded the best average performance, followed closely by latent class analysis. We also report results for the 3 methods within the context of an application to transitive reasoning data, in which it was found that the 3 approaches can exhibit profound differences when applied to real data.

abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}) is becoming one of the major areas of high-throughput biology. Functional analysis, that is, analyzing the data based on metabolic pathways or the genome-scale metabolic network, is critical in feature selection and interpretation of metabolomics data. One of the main challenges in the functional analyses is the lack of the feature identity in the {LC}-{MS} data itself. By matching mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) values of the features to theoretical values derived from known metabolites, some features can be matched to one or more known metabolites. When multiple matchings occur, in most cases only one of the matchings can be true. At the same time, some known metabolites are missing in the measurements. Current network/pathway analysis methods ignore the uncertainty in metabolite identification and the missing observations, which could lead to errors in the selection of significant subnetworks/pathways. In this paper, we propose a flexible network feature selection framework that combines metabolomics data with the genome-scale metabolic network. The method adopts a sequential feature screening procedure and machine learning-based criteria to select important subnetworks and identify the optimal feature matching simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has a much higher sensitivity than the commonly used maximal matching approach. For demonstration, we apply the method on a cohort of healthy subjects to detect subnetworks associated with the body mass index ({BMI}). The method identifies several subnetworks that are supported by the current literature, as well as detects some subnetworks with plausible new functional implications.

To elucidate biotransformation processes, batch experiments with two cyanobacterial species (Microcystis aeruginosa and Synechococcus sp.) and one green algal species (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) were conducted. Twenty-four micropollutants were studied, including 15 fungicides and 9 pharmaceuticals. Online solid phase extraction ({SPE}) coupled with liquid chromatography ({LC})-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry ({HRMS}/{MS}) was used together with suspect and nontarget screening to identify transformation products ({TPs}). 14 {TPs} were identified for 9 micropollutants, formed by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation, conjugation and methylation reactions. The observed transformation pathways included reactions likely mediated by promiscuous enzymes, such as glutamate conjugation to mefenamic acid and pterin conjugation of sulfamethoxazole. For 15 compounds, including all azole fungicides tested, no {TPs} were identified. Environmentally relevant concentrations of chemical stressors had no influence on the transformation types and rates.}

abstract = {Biotransformation of chemical pollutants is an ecological process requiring multifunctionality (multiple metabolic pathways) and, potentially, high biodiversity. Phytoplankton communities are highly diverse functionally and taxonomically and co-occur with complex mixtures of organic pollutants in aquatic environments. Here, we investigated how phytoplankton species richness ({SR}) and class richness ({CR}) determine the biotransformation of a mixture of 37 structurally diverse pollutants using laboratory experiments and analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometry data. Laboratory phytoplankton communities were assembled from pure cultures by creating a gradient from one to five taxonomic groups, and 5 to 11 total species, in defined medium. The biotransformation of pollutants over 6 days and the total number of transformed chemicals increased with {CR} for 13 considerably transformed compounds. The total number of transformation products ({TPs}, up to 42) was positively affected by both {CR} and {SR}: {CR} had a positive effect on stable {TPs} found, and {SR} led to more transient {TPs}. Our data indicate that both taxonomic and functional diversity are important for biotransformation of anthropogenic chemicals in phytoplankton and suggest that plankton biodiversity could play a role in the remediation of pollutant loads in aquatic ecosystems.}

abstract = {{NMR} spectroscopy is an emerging analytical tool for measuring complex drug product qualities, e.g., protein higher order structure ({HOS}) or heparin chemical composition. Most drug {NMR} spectra have been visually analyzed; however, {NMR} spectra are inherently quantitative and multivariate and thus suitable for chemometric analysis. Therefore, quantitative measurements derived from chemometric comparisons between spectra could be a key step in establishing acceptance criteria for a new generic drug or a new batch after manufacture change. To measure the capability of chemometric methods to differentiate comparator {NMR} spectra, we calculated inter-spectra difference metrics on {1D}/{2D} spectra of two insulin drugs, Humulin R\textregistered and Novolin R\textregistered, from different manufacturers. Both insulin drugs have an identical drug substance but differ in formulation. Chemometric methods (i.e., principal component analysis ({PCA}), 3-way Tucker3 or graph invariant ({GI})) were performed to calculate Mahalanobis distance (D M) between the two brands (inter-brand) and distance ratio (D R) among the different lots (intra-brand). The {PCA} on {1D} inter-brand spectral comparison yielded a D M value of 213. In comparing {2D} spectra, the Tucker3 analysis yielded the highest differentiability value (D M = 305) in the comparisons made followed by {PCA} (D M = 255) then the {GI} method (D M = 40). In conclusion, drug quality comparisons among different lots might benefit from {PCA} on {1D} spectra for rapidly comparing many samples, while higher resolution but more time-consuming {2D}-{NMR}-data-based comparisons using Tucker3 analysis or {PCA} provide a greater level of assurance for drug structural similarity evaluation between drug brands.}

Thus, kernel matrix representation provides more intuitively understandable interpretation to the conventional {PARAFAC} trilinear model. In this study, the utility of {PARAFAC} kernel is demonstrated by the study of poly(lactic acid)-nanocomposite undergoing a structural change depending on the temperature as well as the clay content in the sample. Seemingly complicated variation of nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectra induced by the change in the temperature and clay content are readily analyzed by the multiple-perturbation {2D} correlation spectroscopy and {PARAFAC} kernel. {PARAFAC} kernel revealed that crystalline and amorphous structures of the {PLA} substantially undergo thermal deformation, and these variations are also influenced by the presence of the clay.}

abstract = {The value of metabolomics in translational research is undeniable, and metabolomics data are increasingly generated in large cohorts. The functional interpretation of disease-associated metabolites though is difficult, and the biological mechanisms that underlie cell type or disease-specific metabolomics profiles are oftentimes unknown. To help fully exploit metabolomics data and to aid in its interpretation, analysis of metabolomics data with other complementary omics data, including transcriptomics, is helpful. To facilitate such analyses at a pathway level, we have developed {RaMP} (Relational database of Metabolomics Pathways), which combines biological pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}), Reactome, {WikiPathways}, and the Human Metabolome {DataBase} ({HMDB}). To the best of our knowledge, an off-the-shelf, public database that maps genes and metabolites to biochemical/disease pathways and can readily be integrated into other existing software is currently lacking. For consistent and comprehensive analysis, {RaMP} enables batch and complex queries (e.g., list all metabolites involved in glycolysis and lung cancer), can readily be integrated into pathway analysis tools, and supports pathway overrepresentation analysis given a list of genes and/or metabolites of interest. For usability, we have developed a {RaMP} R package (https://github.com/Mathelab/{RaMP}-{DB}), including a user-friendly {RShiny} web application, that supports basic simple and batch queries, pathway overrepresentation analysis given a list of genes or metabolites of interest, and network visualization of gene-metabolite relationships. The package also includes the raw database file (mysql dump), thereby providing a stand-alone downloadable framework for public use and integration with other tools. In addition, the Python code needed to recreate the database on another system is also publicly available (https://github.com/Mathelab/{RaMP}-{BackEnd}). Updates for databases in {RaMP} will be checked multiple times a year and {RaMP} will be updated accordingly.}

abstract = {Computational workflows describe the complex multi-step methods that are used for data collection, data preparation, analytics, predictive modelling, and simulation that lead to new data products. They can inherently contribute to the {FAIR} data principles: by processing data according to established metadata; by creating metadata themselves during the processing of data; and by tracking and recording data provenance. These properties aid data quality assessment and contribute to secondary data usage. Moreover, workflows are digital objects in their own right. This paper argues that {FAIR} principles for workflows need to address their specific nature in terms of their composition of executable software steps, their provenance, and their development.}

abstract = {Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}) acquisitions routinely yield hundreds to thousands of Electron Ionization ({EI}) mass spectra. The chemical identification of these spectra typically involves a search protocol that seeks an exact match to a reference spectrum. Reference spectra are found in comprehensive libraries of small molecule {EI} spectra curated by commercial and public entities. We developed {ARISTO} (Automatic Reduction of Ion Spectra To Ontology), a webtool, which provides information regarding the general chemical nature of the compound underlying an input {EI} mass spectrum. Importantly, {ARISTO} can provide such annotation without necessitating an exact match to a specific compound. {ARISTO} provides assignments to a subset of the {ChEBI} (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) dictionary, an ontology, which aims to cover biologically relevant small molecules. Our system takes as input a mass spectrum represented as a series of mass and intensity pairs; the system returns a graphical representation of the supported ontology as well as a detailed table of suggested annotations along with their associated statistical evidence. {ARISTO} is accessible at this {URL}: http://www.ionspectra.org/aristo. The system is free, open to all and does not require registration of any sort.}

abstract = {Experiments with stable isotope tracers such as {13C} and {15N} are increasingly used to gain insights into metabolism. However, mass spectrometric measurements of stable isotope labeling experiments should be corrected for the presence of naturally occurring stable isotopes and for impurities of the tracer substrate. Here, we analyzed the effect that such correction has on the data: omitting correction or performing invalid correction can result in largely distorted data, potentially leading to misinterpretation. {IsoCorrectoR} is the first R-based tool to offer said correction capabilities. It is easy-to-use and comprises all correction features that comparable tools can offer in a single solution: correction of {MS} and {MS}/{MS} data for natural stable isotope abundance and tracer impurity, applicability to any tracer isotope and correction of multiple-tracer data from high-resolution measurements. {IsoCorrectoR}'s correction performance agreed well with manual calculations and other available tools including Python-based {IsoCor} and Perl-based {ICT}. {IsoCorrectoR} can be downloaded as an R-package from: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{IsoCorrectoR}.html .}

abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Isotope trace ({IT}) detection is a fundamental step for liquid or gas chromatography mass spectrometry ({XC}-{MS}) data analysis that faces a multitude of technical challenges on complex samples. The Kalman filter ({KF}) application to {IT} detection addresses some of these challenges; it discriminates closely eluting {ITs} in the m/z dimension, flexibly handles heteroscedastic m/z variances and does not bin the m/z axis. Yet, the behavior of this {KF} application has not been fully characterized, as no cost-free open-source implementation exists and incomplete evaluation standards for {IT} detection persist. {RESULTS}: Massifquant is an open-source solution for {KF} {IT} detection that has been subjected to novel and rigorous methods of performance evaluation. The presented evaluation with accompanying annotations and optimization guide sets a new standard for comparative {IT} detection. Compared with {centWave}, {matchedFilter} and {MZMine2}-alternative {IT} detection engines-Massifquant detected more true {ITs} in a real {LC}-{MS} complex sample, especially low-intensity {ITs}. It also offers competitive specificity and equally effective quantitation accuracy. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Massifquant is integrated into {XCMS} with {GPL} license ≥ 2.0 and hosted by Bioconductor: http://bioconductor.org.

This article focuses on the different imputation techniques available in the package. Four different imputation methods are currently implemented in {VIM}, namely hot-deck imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, regression imputation and iterative robust model-based imputation (Templ, Kowarik, and Filzmoser 2011). All of these methods are implemented in a flexible manner with many options for customization. Furthermore in this article practical examples are provided to highlight the use of the implemented methods on real-world applications. In addition, the graphical user interface of {VIM} has been re-implemented from scratch resulting in the package {VIMGUI} (Schopfhauser, Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) to enable users without extensive R skills to access these imputation and visualization methods.}

abstract = {Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic networks and transcriptomic data represent complementary sources of knowledge about an organism's metabolism, yet their integration to achieve biological insight remains challenging. Results: We investigate here condition-specific series of metabolic sub-networks constructed by successively removing genes from a comprehensive network. The optimal order of gene removal is deduced from transcriptomic data. The sub-networks are evaluated via a fitness function, which estimates their degree of alteration. We then consider how a gene set, i.e. a group of genes contributing to a common biological function, is depleted in different series of sub-networks to detect the difference between experimental conditions. The method, named {metaboGSE}, is validated on public data for Yarrowia lipolytica and mouse. It is shown to produce {GO} terms of higher specificity compared to popular gene set enrichment methods like {GSEA} or {topGO}. Availability: The {metaboGSE} R package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{metaboGSE}. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

abstract = {In {LC}-{MS} based untargeted analysis, data is collected at the peak or ion level, although the investigated biochemistry processes occur at the compound or reaction level. To this end, the presence of redundancy peaks such as co-eluted peaks, multi-chargers, adducts, neutral loss, isotopologues, and fragments ions often muddle subsequent statistical data analysis. In order to fill this gap, between peaks and compounds/reactions, independent components must first be found at the peak level, then evaluated at the compound or reaction levels. Based on paired mass distances ({PMD}), the algorithm {GlobalStd}, based on retention time hierarchical cluster analysis and global analysis of {PMDs} within clusters, is here proposed to extract independent peaks from raw {LC}-{MS} data. Following its application, a structure/reaction directed analysis can then be used to evaluate compounds at the structure or biochemistry reaction level, based on similar {PMDs} among different retention times clusters. As a proof-of-concept, the developed statistical method was applied to data obtained for in vivo {SPME} sampling on fish. In total, 277 independent peaks were demonstrated to stand for most of the variances found for the total 1459 ions detected via {LC}-{MS}. Following, both known homologous series or biological reactions along with unknown bio-processes, which may involve oxidation/reduction reactions or homologous series, were analyzed via a structure/reaction directed analysis. The findings of this analysis yielded interesting information regarding the data, for instance denoting the possible occurrence of a biosynthesis process involving l-Carnitine and its precursor 4-Trimethylammoniobutanoic acid. Such {PMD} relationships could also aid in the screening of annotation results. To this end, semi-quantitative analysis based on structure/reaction directed analysis is also here proposed for further investigation of unknown patterns or for removal of contaminants in metabolomics studies. The developed data-driven algorithm has been included in a {PMD} package with a {GUI} interactive document, and is freely available online (https://github.com/yufree/pmd).

abstract = {{SWATH}-{MS} based data independent acquisition mass spectrometry ({DIA}-{MS}) technology has been recently developed for untargeted metabolomics due to its capability to acquire all {MS2} spectra and high quantitative accuracy. However, software tools for deconvolving multiplexed {MS}/{MS} spectra from {SWATH}-{MS} with high efficiency and high quality are still lacking in untargeted metabolomics. Here, we developed a new software tool, namely, {DecoMetDIA}, to deconvolve multiplexed {MS}/{MS} spectra for metabolite identification and support the {SWATH} based untargeted metabolomics. In {DecoMetDIA}, it selected multiple model peaks to model the co-eluted and unresolved chromatographic peaks of fragment ions in multiplexed spectra, and decomposed them into a linear combination of the model peaks. {DecoMetDIA} enabled to reconstruct the {MS2} spectra of metabolites from a variety of different biological samples with high coverages. We also demonstrated that the deconvolved {MS2} spectra from {DecoMetDIA} were of high accuracy through the comparison to the experimental {MS2} spectra from data dependent acquisition ({DDA}). Finally, about 90\% of deconvolved {MS2} spectra in various biological samples were successfully annotated using software tools such as {MetDNA} and Sirius. The results demonstrated that the deconvolved {MS2} spectra obtained from {DecoMetDIA} were accurate and valid for metabolite identification and structural elucidation. The comparison of {DecoMetDIA} to other deconvolution software such as {MS}-{DIAL} demonstrated that it performs very well for small polar metabolites. The {DecoMetDIA} software is freely available on the Internet (https://github.com/{ZhuMSLab}/{DecoMetDIA}).}

abstract = {Nowadays most metabolomic studies involve the analysis of large sets of samples to find a representative metabolite pattern associated to the factor under study. During a sequence of analyses the instrument signals can be subjected to the influence of experimental variability sources. Implementation of quality control ({QC}) samples to check the contribution of experimental variability is the most common approach in metabolomics. This practice is based on the filtration of molecular entities experiencing a variation coefficient higher than that measured in the {QC} data set. Although other robust correction algorithms have been proposed, none of them has provided an easy-to-use and easy-to-install tool capable of correcting experimental variability sources. In this research an R-package -the {MetaboQC}- has been developed to correct intra-day and inter-days variability using {QCs} analyzed within a pre-set sequence of experiments. {MetaboQC} has been tested in two data sets to assess the correction effects by comparing the metabolites variability before and after application of the proposed tool. As a result, the number of entities in {QCs} significantly different between days was reduced from 86\% to 19\% in the negative ionization mode and from 100\% to 13\% in the positive ionization mode. Furthermore, principal component analysis allowed detecting the filtration of instrumental variability associated to the injection order. Copyright \copyright 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

abstract = {Untargeted metabolomics by mass spectrometry in the form of mass over charge and intensity of ions, provides insight into the metabolic activity in a sample and is therefore essential to understand regulation and expression at the protein and transcription level. Problematically, it is often challenging to analyze untargeted metabolomics data as many m/z values are detected per sample and it is difficult to identify what compound they represent. We aimed to facilitate the process of finding m/z biomarkers through statistical analysis, machine learning and searching for their putative identities. To address this challenge, we developed {MetaboShiny}, a novel R and {RShiny} based metabolomics data analysis package. {MetaboShiny} features bi/multivariate and temporal statistics, an extensive machine learning module, interactive plotting and result exploration, and compound identification through a variety of chemical databases. As a result, {MetaboShiny} enables rapid and rigorous analysis of untargeted metabolomics data as well as target identification at unprecedented scale. To demonstrate its efficacy and ease-of-use, we apply {MetaboShiny} to a publicly accessible metabolomics dataset generated from the urine of smokers and non-smokers. Replication of the main results of the original publication, which includes importing, normalization and several statistical analyses, is achieved within minutes. Moreover, {MetaboShiny} enables deeper exploration of the data thereby revealing novel putative biomarkers and hypotheses. For instance, by using {MetaboShiny\textquoterights} subsetting feature, iodine is found to be significantly increased in non-smoking lung cancer patients. Furthermore, by allowing for custom adducts, {MetaboShiny} reveals a putative identification for an m/z value which could not be identified by the original authors. This validates {MetaboShiny} as a flexible and customizable data analysis package that greatly enhances metabolomics biomarker discovery.}

abstract = {High-throughput metabolomics using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry ({LC}/{MS}) provides a useful method to identify biomarkers of disease and explore biological systems. However, the majority of metabolic features detected from untargeted metabolomics experiments have unknown ion signatures, making it critical that data should be thoroughly quality controlled to avoid analyzing false signals. Here, we present a postalignment method relying on intermittent pooled study samples to separate genuine metabolic features from potential measurement artifacts. We apply the method to lipid metabolite data from the {PREDIMED} ({PREvenci}ón con {DIeta} {MEDi}-terránea) study to demonstrate clear removal of measurement artifacts. The method is publicly available as the R package {MetProc}, available on {CRAN} under the {GPL}-v2 license.}

abstract = {Leukemia cell and melanoma tumor tissue extracts were studied for small (mostly m/z \textless 250) polar metabolites by {LC}-{ESI}-{HRMSn} analysis powered by a hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap. {MS} data were simultaneously acquired in fast polarity switching mode operating in {MS1} and {MS}/{MS} (All Ion Fragmentation, {AIF}) full-scan analyses at high mass resolution. Positive metabolite assignments were achieved by {AIF} analysis considering at least two characteristic transitions. Targeted metabolite profiling was achieved by the relative quantification of 18 metabolites through spiking of their respective deuterated counterparts. Manual data processing of {MS1} and {AIF} scans were compared for the accurate determination of natural metabolites and their deuterated analogs by chromatographic alignment and peak area integration. Evaluation of manual and automated ({MetaboList} R package) {AIF} data processing yielded comparable results. The versatility of {AIF} analysis also enabled the untargeted metabolite profiling of leukemia and melanoma samples in which 22 and 53 compounds were, respectively, identified outside those studied by labeling. The main limitation of this method was that low abundance metabolites with scan rates below 8 scans/peak could not be accurately quantified by {AIF} analysis. The combination of {AIF} analysis with {MetaboList} R package represents an opportunity to move towards automated, faster, and more global metabolomics approaches supported by an entirely flexible open source data processing platform freely available from Comprehensive R Archive Network ({CRAN}, https://{CRAN}.R-project.org/package={MetaboList}).}

abstract = {A key issue in the omics literature is the search for statistically significant relationships between molecular markers and phenotype. The aim is to detect disease-related discriminatory features while controlling for false positive associations at adequate power. Metabolome-wide association studies have revealed significant relationships of metabolic phenotypes with disease risk by analysing hundreds to tens of thousands of molecular variables leading to multivariate data which are highly noisy and collinear. In this context, conventional Bonferroni or Sidak multiple testing corrections are rather useful as these are valid for independent tests, while permutation procedures allow for the estimation of significance levels from the null distribution without assuming independence among features. Nevertheless, under the permutation approach the distribution of p-values may present systematic deviations from the theoretical null distribution which leads to overly conservative adjusted threshold estimates i.e. smaller than a Bonferroni or Sidak correction. We make use of parametric approximation methods based on a multivariate Normal distribution to derive stable estimates of the metabolome-wide significance level. A univariate approach is applied based on a permutation procedure which effectively controls the overall type I error rate at the \alpha level. We illustrate the approach for different model parametrizations and distributional features of the outcome measure, using both simulated and real data. We also investigate different levels of correlation within the features and between the features and the outcome. {MWSL} is an open-source R software package for the empirical estimation of the metabolome-wide significance level available at https://github.com/{AlinaPeluso}/{MWSL}.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: In metabolomics studies, unwanted variation inevitably arises from various sources. Normalization, that is the removal of unwanted variation, is an essential step in the statistical analysis of metabolomics data. However, metabolomics normalization is often considered an imprecise science due to the diverse sources of variation and the availability of a number of alternative strategies that may be implemented. {OBJECTIVES}: We highlight the need for comparative evaluation of different normalization methods and present software strategies to help ease this task for both data-oriented and biological researchers. {METHODS}: We present {NormalizeMets}-a joint graphical user interface within the familiar Microsoft Excel and freely-available R software for comparative evaluation of different normalization methods. The {NormalizeMets} R package along with the vignette describing the workflow can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{NormalizeMets}/ . The Excel Interface and the Excel user guide are available on https://metabolomicstats.github.io/{ExNormalizeMets} . {RESULTS}: {NormalizeMets} allows for comparative evaluation of normalization methods using criteria that depend on the given dataset and the ultimate research question. Hence it guides researchers to assess, select and implement a suitable normalization method using either the familiar Microsoft Excel and/or freely-available R software. In addition, the package can be used for visualisation of metabolomics data using interactive graphical displays and to obtain end statistical results for clustering, classification, biomarker identification adjusting for confounding variables, and correlation analysis. {CONCLUSION}: {NormalizeMets} is designed for comparative evaluation of normalization methods, and can also be used to obtain end statistical results. The use of freely-available R software offers an attractive proposition for programming-oriented researchers, and the Excel interface offers a familiar alternative to most biological researchers. The package handles the data locally in the user's own computer allowing for reproducible code to be stored locally.}

This method produces a large amount of raw data that requires downstream processing to align signals of interest (peaks) across multiple samples and match peak characteristics to reference standard libraries prior to downstream statistical analysis. To address the paucity of applications addressing this need, we have developed an R package that implements retention time and mass spectra similarity threshold-free alignments, seamlessly integrates retention time standards for universally reproducible alignments, performs common ion filtering, and provides compatibility with multiple peak quantification methods. We demonstrate the packages utility on a controlled mix of metabolite standards separated under variable chromatography conditions and data generated from cell lines.}
